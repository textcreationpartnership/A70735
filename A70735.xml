            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Many years are paſt with various Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſince in the firſt Fluctuations of the late Grand Rebellion, I being left at leiſure from former Imployments belonging to the quiet of Peace wherein I was bred, in ſtead of Arms, to which in parties moſt began to buckle, I betook my ſelf to ſomething of <hi>Literature,</hi> in which, till then, altogether a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; And drawing towards the Evening of my Age, I made a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Progreſs, bending my ſelf to ſofter Studies, adapted to my Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Inclinations, <hi>Poeſie:</hi> And firſt Rallying my new rais'd Forces, a ſmall and inconſiderable parcel of <hi>Latin,</hi> I undertook no leſs a Conqueſt, than the Reducing into our Native Language; the Great Maſter and Grand Improver of that Tongue, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Roman</hi> Poets; and though I fell much ſhort in this my vain Enterpriſe, yet ſuch, and ſo happy prov'd the Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo fairly accepted, that of me, till then obſcure, <hi>Fame</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prattle, and ſoon after I, forſooth, ſtood forth a new <hi>Author,</hi> and ſo much cheer'd up with freſh Encouragements, that from a <hi>Mean Octavo,</hi> a <hi>Royal Folio</hi> Flouriſh'd, Adorn'd with Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Illuſtrated with Annotations, Triumphing with the affixt Emblazons, Names, and Titles of a hundred <hi>Patrons,</hi> all bold Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors in Vindication of the Work, which (what e're my Deſerts) being Publiſh'd with that Magnificence and Splendor, appear'd a new, and taking Beauty, the faireſt that till then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preſs ever boaſted.</p>
            <p>Yet this firſt Endeavour rais'd my Reputation no farther, than to be accounted a Good <hi>Tranſlator,</hi> a Faithful <hi>Interpreter,</hi> one that had dabled well in anothers <hi>Helicon;</hi> but I, greedy of more,
<pb facs="tcp:56692:8"/>having taſted the ſweetneſs of a little Fame, would not thus ſit down, but ambitious to try my own Wing, endeavor'd to Sore a little higher. The moſt Antient and Wiſeſt of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Sages, who firſt led us through a Vocal Foreſt, where Beaſts alſo ſpake, and Birds ſat Chanting in every Tree, Notes for Men to follow: <hi>Aeſop</hi> the Prince of <hi>Mythologiſts</hi> became my Quarry, on his plain Song I Deſcanted, on his ſhort and pithy Sayings, Paraphras'd, raiſing my voice to ſuch a height, that I took my degree amongſt the <hi>Minor Poets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My next Expedition with Sails a Trip, and ſwoln with the Breath of a general Applauſe, was to diſcover <hi>Greece,</hi> that there, I might from <hi>Homers</hi> own hand, the King of <hi>Pernaſſus,</hi> receive plentifully at the Fountain-Head ſtaining Draughts of the brisker <hi>Hypocreen;</hi> in which I had a double Deſign, not onely to bring over ſo Antient and Famous an Author, but to inable my ſelf the better to carry on an <hi>Epick Poem</hi> of my own Compoſure; whoſe <hi>Iliads</hi> with much Coſt and Labor at laſt finiſhing, being Dedicated to His Sacred Majeſty, and Crown'd with His Gracious Acceptance, I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd my Poſt, looſing no ground of former Reputation.</p>
            <p>Soon after, being order'd by the <hi>Commiſsion of Triumphs,</hi> to Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet His Majeſty at the Cities coſt with a <hi>Poetick Entertainment,</hi> Marching with His Train of Nobles through His Imperial Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to His Corronation at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Argument being great, ſeeming almoſt impoſsible to ſet forth the Dear Affections, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſsible Joys of all His Loyal Subjects, eſpecially of His <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis London,</hi> at His ſo Happy Reſtauration; and that the Glory of ſo Bright a Day, the moſt Splendid that e're this Nation ſaw, ſhould not cloſe with the Setting-Sun, but appear a ſhining Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy to Poſterity; I, at my own proper Coſt and Pains, brought it to light once more, in a <hi>Royal Folio,</hi> containing the whole Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Triumphal Arches and <hi>Cavalcade,</hi> delineated in Sculpture, the Speeches and Impreſſes Illuſtrated from Antiquity, and Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to His Majeſty; of which, ſome, and but a few, eſcaping the late Conflagration, remain'd.</p>
            <p>But whilſt I buſied my ſelf thus, neither ſparing Coſt nor Pains, to dreſs and ſet forth my own Volumns with all the Splendor and Oſtentation that could be, I thought it alſo Religious, and the part of a good Chriſtian, to do ſomething for Gods ſake, to adorn in like manner, with Ornamental Accompliſhments, the <hi>Holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> which by my own ſole Conduct, proper Coſt and Charges, at laſt appear'd the largeſt and faireſt Edition that was ever yet ſet forth in any Vulgar Tongue.</p>
            <p>Next in order to the compleating of <hi>Homer,</hi> I fell upon his <hi>Odiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> which Dedicated to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> then His Majeſties Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to whom, in that Kingdom, in the late miſerable Diſtractions, I was a Servant, he kindly accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:56692:8"/>
            <p>Then, being reſtleſs, though weary of tedious Verſions, and ſuch long Journeys in Tranſlating Greek and Latin Poets, Works asking no leſs than a Mans whole life to accompliſh, I, the better to feed my Fancy with variety of Objects, a ſecond time betook my ſelf to <hi>Aeſop,</hi> where I found ſuch Succeſs, that ſoon I ſeem'd to tread Air, and walk alone, becoming alſo a <hi>Mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt;</hi> not onely Paraphraſing, but a Deſigner of my own Fables, and at laſt ſcrew'd my ſelf up to a greater height, finiſhing two He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Poems, <hi>viz. The Epheſian Matron,</hi> and <hi>The Roman Slave,</hi> which Volumn, a moſt Worthy and Illuſtrious Perſon, the Earl of <hi>Oſſery,</hi> vouchſafed to Patronize; and although a Second Part, met with a Fate not common, to be eſteem'd equal with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>Thus elevated by the Succeſs of theſe my laſt heightned Eſſays, I thought it time to go on (having fitted Materials, both Hiſtorick and Poetick) with my long intended Edifice, my own great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, an <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> already divided into twelve Books, ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt finiſh'd, call'd <hi>CAROLIES,</hi> from our Miracle of <hi>Hero's, Charles</hi> the Firſt, being the beſt Pattern of true Prudence, Valor, and Chriſtian Piety; of whom, though too late, and too unworthy to be affix'd to his Herſe, out of the abundance of my Zeal and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to ſo matchleſs a Worthy; I hope there may be indulgence for the placing theſe Lines, which may remain to Poſterity, in the Portal of this Great Work.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Mirror of Princes! <hi>Charles,</hi> the Royal Martyr,</l>
               <l>Who for Religion, and His Subjects Charter,</l>

               <l>Whoſe Sufferance, Patience, reach'd to ſuch a height,</l>
               <l>For Angels onely with Sun-beams to write:</l>
               <l>No mortal Hand, leſs my unworthy Pen,</l>
               <l>Fit to Diſplay the beſt of Kings and Men.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This Work thus ſettled, and ſo well reſolv'd upon to be the Pride, Divertiſement, Buſineſs, and ſole Comfort of my Age, that day annually ſo fatal to the Royal Party, ſwallow'd in that devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deluge of Fire, with moſt part of the City, that, and my whole Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Thus fall'n into a low condition, groaning under a double bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of Sickneſs and Poverty, and almoſt quite deſpairing, the Work that might have Boy'd me up once more, thus irrecoverably loſt; and reminding, that many of my Friends, and Worthy Patrons were more favorable to my Endeavors, when under a Cloud, than after Shining in full Luſtre; and that ſince his Majeſties Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the minds of thoſe reſtor'd to former Fortunes, or rais'd to ſeveral Advancements, were more abroad, and not at leiſure to
<pb facs="tcp:56692:9"/>look on ſuch private Divertiſements at home; ſo that thoſe later Volumns, which in courſe were Printed to perfect the former, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd a Drug, until the inſatiate Flames, at once, and in one bad Market, clear'd me of my Store, and Houſe alſo.</p>
            <p>Beſides grave <hi>Poeſie,</hi> in which <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil's Heros</hi> ſpake Honor, and the greatneſs of their Souls; comprizing in few Lines, by Example, more Rules of good Life, than Phyloſophers in many Volumns; looſing place and former Luſtre, <hi>Rough Satyr, Rude Traveſtee,</hi> and <hi>Rhime Doggerel,</hi> gotten above, aſsiſted with ſuch, that confidently avouch, that we in this more Refin'd Age, ſpeak better things <hi>ex tempore,</hi> than what hath been Recorded by the whole Rabble of Antiquity; looking down upon Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as ſtale Saws, and ſtiff Formalities, onely fit for School-Boys <hi>Theams,</hi> and that our Brisker Youth, and more Sublime Wits, ſhould be aſham'd to peruſe, much more to follow.</p>
            <p>Thus a new <hi>Gaggle</hi> drowning the old Quire of <hi>Melodious Swans,</hi> I reſolv'd to deſiſt; and ſhutting up the Fountain of the <hi>Muſes,</hi> left Clambering ſteep <hi>Pernaſſus,</hi> and fell into the beaten way, and more frequented Paths of <hi>Proſe:</hi> My firſt undertaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>An Embaſſy from New Batavia, to the Emperor of China,</hi> which Publiſh'd in my laſt Lottery, prov'd ſo acceptable, that I reſolv'd to carry on in the ſame way hereafter, the whole Buſineſs of my Pen.</p>
            <p>When, as in my former Acquiſitions, I flew firſt at the higheſt and beſt <hi>Poetick Authors;</hi> ſo now as much ambitious, I pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like Accompliſhment in <hi>Proſe,</hi> and no leſs ſerves my turn, than the Reducement of the whole World, <hi>viz.

            </p>
            <p>THe Particular Authors for the ſeveral Provinces, beginning with <hi>Egypt,</hi> are, <hi>Johannes de Leo,</hi> or <hi>Africanus, Louis Marmol, Sanutus, Francois Alvarez, Peter Belonius, Vilamont, Radziviel, Johannes Alpinus, Santen Segueſſe, Caeſar, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Matthias Voſsius, Peter de la Valle, Balthazar Tellez;</hi> theſe being <hi>Portugueſe, Italian, Latin,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Writers; beſides the Deſcriptions of other both Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Modern Geographers; as, <hi>Strabo, Dionyſius, Perigetes, Pomponius Mela, Ptolomy, Cluverius, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>THoſe that give us an Account of <hi>Barbary,</hi> are the afore-mention'd <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Marmol, Diego de Haedo, Johannes Gramaye, Braeves, Cel.

In like manner, there is taken out of the firſt Part of <hi>Leo, Marmol,</hi> and <hi>Sanutus,</hi> all that lies in <hi>Numidia, Biledulgerid,</hi> and <hi>Libia,</hi> or <hi>Zaahra,</hi> and the inmoſt part of <hi>Negro-land.</hi>

            <p>THe Territories and Coaſts of the <hi>Nether-Ethiopia</hi> are lately as well Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd and Delineated; firſt, by that Eminent Author <hi>Johan de Barros;</hi> next, <hi>Pigafet, Sanutus, Jarrick, Moquet, Od.

               <p>¶ THe Ancients never had any clear Proſpect of <hi>Africa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Ignorance of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</note> more than what vergeth the <hi>Mid-land</hi> Sea; the reſt obſcure; onely gueſſing or hear-ſay: but of all beyond the head Springs of <hi>Nile,</hi> and the Mountains of the Moon, they were utterly ignorant (being within theſe laſt two hundred years diſcovered to us) becauſe much of thoſe vaſt Tracts of <hi>Africa</hi> lying under the Torrid Zone, they concluded not habitable, being parcht up with the Suns exceſſive
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56692:14"/>heat, therefore they never thought of further Penetrations, but blockt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up with a poſſeſt prejudice, and their own ignorance: Yet for all this, ſome old Writers admit moſt parts to be habitable, but with ſuch monſtrous Nations, that they deſerve not to be accounted Humane, as

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Africa</hi> habitable, and why.</note> manifeſting the contrary; for the In-land Regions are found for the moſt part habitable, and the Suns heat by ſhorter days and coolneſs of an equal night, aſſiſted with moiſtening Dews, and freſh Breezes, is much moderated; And though <hi>Africa</hi> hath many Deſarts, yet the greateſt part, eſpecially under and on each ſide the Aequator, ſuppos'd to be moſt inſupportable, abounds with Springs, Brooks, and Shade-caſting Trees; Beſides under the Equinox, the Seaſons of the Year differ from other Climates, for our remoter Suns bring Cold and Wet; our nearer, Heat and Drowth; but there the contrary: which many admire, yet never dive into the Occult Cauſe, but ſtraight flying to Providence, ſay, ſo it muſt be: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe who could inhabit there? which though we ſhould not altogether reject, yet God working by ſecondary means, we may, modeſtly enquire by what? which may probably be thus.</p>
               <p>¶ THe Sun darting fiery Beams daily perpendicular into the Sea, raiſeth abundance of Vapour, which ſuddenly aſcendeth the Airs colder Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and there thinly cruſting, becomes Snow, which ſinking from thence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves into a miſty Cloud, or Dewy Rain, then increaſing its velocity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of deſcending Bodies, and alſo quitting that ſtation, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into bigger drops, which if in abundance, (as oft happens) falls with the greater violence, no more a Shower, but like Buckets-full, or Cataracts, whoſe irruption and ſudden diſ-embogue, agitating the <hi>medium,</hi> raiſeth mighty and cooling Winds, which together ſupplies the parched Earth, and refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the ſultry Air.</p>
               <p>¶ BUt yet this bleſſing extends not to the In-land Countreys, nor hath the <hi>Atlantick Ocean</hi> any ſuch influence upon the Weſtern Coaſts, unleſs (which is very rare) the Winde comes from Sea, becauſe the condenſed Air, the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it penetrates, the more it rarifies, attenuated by the invading heat of the Soyl, that before it ſcarce contributes a Dew to ſtiffen the upper Sands, in a thin Cloud, re-aſcending, vaniſheth.</p>
               <p>But yet the In-land and utmoſt Weſtern Shores need not much complain, being for the moſt part Hilly, for there the Mountains are glutted with aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous ſhowres, for thoſe huge congeſted Heaps, being the higheſt in the world, withſtanding the Airs conſtant motion, ſtill agitated from Eaſt to Weſt, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Copernicus,</hi> lagging from the Earths diurnal Courſe, which moves ſwifteſt under the Equator, condenſeth by Reverberation the ſubtiler Air into
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56692:14"/>its firſt Original, Water, which in the tumultuous commotions of eddying Windes, either finding, or forcing their paſſage, through unequal Glens and Declivings of the byaſs'd Mountains, they drive a conſtant trade, ſtill brewing all ſorts of ſtirring weather, as Winde, Rain, Hail, and Snow, which often covers their Skie-kiſſing Tops.</p>
               <p>But theſe jarrings of the Elements there, produce happy effects below, vaſt Champaignes, which elſe would be all Deſarts by natural Drowth, flouriſh in perpetual Green, fann'd always with cooling Gales, and kept moiſt with Mountain-floods, which converted into Springs, Brooks, and Rivulets, water in their <hi>Meandring</hi> Courſes, barren Plains like a Garden; ſo that as in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe you every where find ſhady and branching Trees, bearing allſorts of Fruit, like <hi>Alcinous</hi> Orchard, ſtill bloſſoming, green, and ripe.

               <p>Thus <hi>Africa,</hi> which elſe would be a miſerable and unfrequented Deſolation, is fruitful and populous, having alternately two Winters and Summers every year; Drowth making one, Moiſture the other: but the tops and heads of theſe Mountains, according to their various Poſitions, differ from this general Rule, making ſome exceptions, ſetling their ſeveral Seaſons otherwiſe; Of which I will inſtance ſome few.</p>
               <p>¶ ON the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar,</hi> Winter rules from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>September;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Nature of the Air.</note> Summer commenceth with the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> ſhutting up with the end of <hi>March:</hi> On the <hi>Coromandell</hi> Shores, juſt the contrary, yet both ſcituated alike under the Torrid Zone, in which Seaſon happen great Floods, both from the Ocean, and ſudden Falls from the Mount <hi>Gatis,</hi> not far diſtant. The like is found alſo at <hi>Cape Roſalgate,</hi> and <hi>Guardafuy,</hi> the utmoſt Eaſtern Point of <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>¶ BUt to make a deeper and more exact Diſquiſition, is, that all <hi>Arabia</hi> towards the Eaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> lies encloſed with Mountains, whoſe Rocky Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments appear above the Clouds, their ſwoln Ridges extending themſelves in a long continued Wall, reach from the bottom of the <hi>Arabian Gulf,</hi> to the Iſlands of <hi>Curiamurie;</hi> theſe towery Hills of ſo prodigious height, not onely put to a ſtand all Windes and Rain, but turn them in their hurrying Eddyes, ſo diſperſing every way, as well as in the two out-ſtretching Capes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamde</hi> and <hi>Roſalgate,</hi> though they lye much lower than the reſt of the Sea Coaſt: On theſe Rocky Aſcents, appearing to Sea-ward rough and rugged, the poor Arabians, in a very ſad condition make their reſidence.</p>
               <p>Theſe people have Winter with thoſe of <hi>Coromandell;</hi> for their remoter Suns brings them Cold and Wet: but thoſe who dwell on the other ſide of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56692:15"/>Mountains towards the Coaſt of <hi>Frankincenſe,</hi> have the ſame ſeaſons with thoſe of <hi>Malabar;</hi> ſo theſe Mountains work the like effect on the <hi>Arabians,</hi> as <hi>Gatis</hi> on the <hi>Indians,</hi> their Winter falling in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> both in the Land of <hi>Frankincenſe, Arabia Felix,</hi> and the whole Coaſts of the <hi>Curiamurian</hi> Iſles, unto the Lake <hi>Babalmandab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Near the <hi>Arabian Gulf</hi> in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> you will meet there alſo the like altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the ſame ſeaſons of the year as at <hi>Guardafuy,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Adell,</hi> and all along the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Coaſts, to the Mouth of <hi>Babalmandab,</hi> as we have, or thoſe of <hi>Coromandell,</hi> finding in <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January</hi> their hardeſt weather.</p>
               <p>Then they which live betwixt twenty and thirty miles off the Coaſt, have their Colds more milde, and their Rains ſo temperate and harmleſs, they ſeem rather a comfort than a diſturbance, Nature conferring on them ſuch refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coolneſs: but if you venture farther up into the Countrey, then the <hi>Scene</hi> changing, you are tormented with exceſſive Heat, for at the ſame inſtant while Winter ſmiles on the Shore, it rages farther up, and their gentle Rains below ſo unequal to their deluging Showres above, that then there is no travelling any way, all Paſſages being obſtructed with Floods, ſo ſudden and violent, that many periſh there with extream Cold, meerly from the raw De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes of chilling waters; ſuch alterations the Mountain <hi>Dabyri Bizan</hi> cauſes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugees</hi> and <hi>Hollander</hi> have alſo diſcovered many more ſuch places in <hi>Congo</hi> and <hi>Angola,</hi> where their Winter and violent Rains commence in the <hi>Vernal Equinox,</hi> and continue <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> their milder ſhowres in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal, <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> ſo that in ſome places they have two Seaſons, their former and later Rain; for thoſe ſteep Mountains (whence <hi>Zaire, Coanſa, Bengo,</hi> and other great Rivers deſcend) obſtruct the courſe of the Air, and the Land-windes, being hot and dry, but the South-weſt winde coming from Sea, brings Rain: hence it is manifeſt that <hi>Africa</hi> under the Torrid Zone, is for the moſt part Habitable.</p>

Each Leg hath onely one Knee-joynt or bending, though they ſeem more, becauſe of the truſſneſs of his Hips, and ſhort Buttocks; his Dung is like that of an Ox, his Gall lyes not ſeparated as in other Beaſts, but keeps in certain veins: Nature, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> write, hath beſtowed on him two Maws, becauſe he eats Thiſtles and Thorns, for the Uval of his Mouth, and the inward Skin of his Maw, are very rough.</p>

               <p>When they load a Camel, or unload, he ſinks down on his Belly, and when he feels that he hath a ſufficient Burthen, he riſes, nor will take more upon him than he is able to carry: The African Camel far excels the Aſiatick, for they travel forty or fifty days without Provender,

               <p>The <hi>Lybian</hi> or <hi>Mauritanian</hi> are leſſer than the <hi>Indian,</hi> and (as <hi>Polybius</hi> writes) can not endure the Voice or Cry of the <hi>Indian Elephant;</hi> The <hi>Indian,</hi> though the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of all, differ in ſize much amongſt themſelves; They ſhew'd one at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> that was eleven Foot betwixt his Eyes; and the utmoſt of his Trunk, from his Eye eight Foot in length: many are nine Foot high, ſome above eleven; <hi>Aloyſius Camuſtus</hi> ſaw one whoſe fleſh weighed more than five of our Stall-fed Oxen; They are all black, except the <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> yet the Relaters of the <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Voyages ſay, that the King of <hi>Narſinga</hi> had a white Elephant.</p>
               <p>Their Skin is rough and hard, but more on the back than the belly; they have four teeth that are Chawers, beſides their Tusks which ſtick out of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and are crooked, but the Females are ſtreight; ſome of theſe Tusks are of an incredible bigneſs: <hi>Vertomanus</hi> ſaw two at the Iſle of <hi>Sumatra</hi> that weigh'd three hundred thirty ſix pound. <hi>Polybius</hi> ſays, that in the borders of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> they are us'd for Jaums of Gates and Door-poſts, and in Beaſts-ſtalls for ſtakes.</p>
               <p>For a Noſe or a Snout, they have a long, ſmall, hanging part, call'd a <hi>Trunk,</hi> reaching the ground and open, being ſinewy and bending every way, it ſerves him for a Hand, with which he gathers both his Food and Potation, conveying ſo to his Mouth; through this he alſo breathes and ſmells: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, they have Joynts in their hinder Feet below, but others write variouſly concerning the flexure of their Knees; ſome ſay they have Joynts in their Legs; others the contrary, and that if fallen they cannot riſe: <hi>Plinie</hi> ſays (which experience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) that they have ſhort Joynts in their hinder Legs, bending inwards like a Mans; their Feet are round like Horſes Hooffs, but larger. <hi>Vertomanus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them to a round Table, their broad ſoal being eighteen inches over; their Toes (being five) look as if all one piece, being black and ſquadded, an unlick'd piece, ſo little cloven that they ſcarce make any ſeparation. This creature hath two Teats, not on her Breaſts but backwards, and more concealed; His Pizzle little, comparing his huge Bulk, and like a Stallions; his Stones appear not, but abſcond about his Reins, which apts him more for Generation.</p>

                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>I my ſelf writ this, and offer'd up to the Celtick ſpoil. Elian</hi> tells us that they us'd to eat handſomly, and ſit mannerly like men, not tearing or devouring their Victuals: when they drank, they took their Cup, delivering it to the next, draining the Goblet, moderately ſprinkling the remainder as in a Joke upon the beholders; when they would paſs any water that is ſcarce fordable, the talleſt of them enters firſt, the reſt paſſing by him, as it were a Bridge, to whom they caſt Branches of Trees to help out at laſt.</p>
               <p>Some affirm that they are Religious, adoring the moſt Eminent Lights, the Sun and Moon; and alſo hoſpitable, directing wandring Paſſengers when out of their way; obſerve Murtherers and other Criminals, and will detect ſuch Guilty Offenders; how they will toſs a Pike, and Fence one with another, playing out their ſeveral Weapons, and Dance after a Warlike manner. <hi>Auge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Busbeek</hi> writes in his <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Letters, how he ſaw a young Elephant that Danc'd to a Song, and play'd at Stool-Ball, ſtriking and retorting with his Trunk, as we with our hands; one at <hi>Rome</hi> would tye and untye hard knots by Moon-light, ſo cunningly complicated, that none elſe could unlooſe them, and patiently receive correction from his Maſter when he fail'd, and was out.</p>
               <p>The female excels the Male in ſtrength and hardineſs; yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes the Female more timerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oppianus</hi> tells that they will beat down with their Teeth, Beech, Olive, and Palm-trees; and whole Houſes, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> relates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vertomannus</hi> Stories that an Elephant threw down a Tree, whoſe body four men could not Fathom, and that three Elephans drew a great Veſſel on ſhore.</p>

               <p>Authors vary concerning their Copulation: <hi>Pliny</hi> will have the Male fit at Five years, the Female at Ten; but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> allows Twenty years to both, of Twelve to the Female, if forwards; if ſlow, fifteen; they conjoyn uſually in the water, which is eaſier for both, for the water ſupports the Male, and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens ſo great a burthen, and fetches him after the Encounter more nimbly off; they deal in love-affairs very private, and but once in three years; chooſing every Triennial a new Miſtreſs, which work concluded they grow wild and almoſt ſtark mad, throwing down their Stalls and Stables; their time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction is alſo uncertain, ſome ſay they go Eighteen Months, others Three
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56692:19"/>Years; a few ſtretch it to Ten, and theſe reduce it to Eight years; in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel their pangs are great, ſquatting down on their hinder Legs, bringing but one at a birth, though others ſay, four; their young ſee and go as ſoon as born, Sucking with his Mouth, not his Trunk, Eight years.</p>
               <p>They are taken ſeveral ways both in <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>India:</hi> The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> knowing the Elephants Night-repoſes, where he alwayes withdraws to ſleep, catch him in a ſtrong Paliſado made of Timber, in a cloſe Covert, a Trap-Door left open lying on the ground, which when the Elephant is in, they ſculking in a Tree, draw up and ſhut with Ropes: when they have him ſure in the Trap, they deſcend and ſhoot him to Death with Arrows; but if he chance to eſcape, rending their Gins, he ſpares none, killing all he meets.</p>
               <p>Others Saw a great Tree half in ſunder, making a pit on the ſide, then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it, which the Elephant ſuſpecting nothing, being weary, retires to his old reſting place, to which, he leaning, his weight overſets the half-cut Trunk, which failing, he falls into the covered Hole, and finds himſelf their Priſoner.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Zenega</hi> near <hi>Cape de Verd,</hi> the Inhabitants, ſixty in a Company, draw forth, each Arm'd with ſix ſmall, and one great Arrow, ſo finding his haunt, they ſtay till he reſorts thither, which, by the loud ruſling noiſe he makes, burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through oppoſing Branches, and overthrowing whole Trees, keeping his march, they know, then they follow him ſhooting continually, till their ſo many infixed Shafts, may bring him to his end, which the Blacks obſerve by the loſs of Blood, and the ſtronger reſiſtance of his confining Paliſado againſt his feebler charge.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Unicorn.</note> in <hi>Upper-Ethiopia,</hi> breeds the Unicorn: <hi>Garcias ab horto</hi> tells, that he ſaw one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> and <hi>Cape de Currentes,</hi> though Modern Authors do not without cauſe deny, and hold it a Fiction, and that there can be no ſuch Creature as the Antients deſcribe. <hi>Strabo</hi> out of <hi>Oneſicritus</hi> ſaith, it is like a Horſe; but <hi>Philes,</hi> that his Tail being ringl'd, reſembles a Wild Boar, and that he opens his Mouth like a Lyon: According to <hi>Pliny,</hi> he hath a Harts head, Feet like an Elephant, Tail of a Boar, and the reſt repreſenting a Horſe, with a Horn in his Forehead two Cubits long: <hi>Iſidorus</hi> makes him the ſame with the <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> affirming his Horn ſo ſtrong and mighty, that he either breaks or penetrates quite through what e're he ſtrikes: <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus</hi> tells us, that the Great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> uſes them, and that in the Region of <hi>Lambri,</hi> they are ſmaller than an Elephant, having a flat head like a wild Swine, an angular Tongue, wherewith they take in what food they can get, and the reſt of their Shape agrees with the <hi>Rhinoceros.</hi> One <hi>Lewis de Barthema</hi> of <hi>Bononia</hi> writes thus of it: <hi>Near the Temple at</hi> Mecha, <hi>are Stables wherein they keep two living Unicorns; the one having a Horn near four handfuls in length. But the other being of the growth of a Colt of two years and a half old, had a Horn on his Forehead near ſeven foot long, the Body being of a ſad Colour, with a Head like a Hart, ſhort Neck, little Hair, and thinly Main'd, ſpindle ſhanks like a Deer, Feet with Hooves a little cloven; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by nature Wild, and loving ſolitude:</hi> That which we call in <hi>Europe</hi> the Unicorns Horn, and preſerve as a coſtly and rare Cordial, belongs to a Monſter or Sea-fiſh taken in the North-Seas, upon the Coaſts of <hi>Iſland, Greenland,</hi> and other adjacent Iſles: which we thus deſcribe.</p>
               <p>It is a full and well-grown Fiſh, near eighteen foot long, and twelve broad;

The Back-bone conſiſts of many ſtrong Joynts, ending in a forked tail, armed on both ſides with ſtrong prickles: The Horn is ſtreight, hard, white, and ſo neatly adorned with deep wreathings, as if it were ſmoothly poliſh'd, and Artificially turn'd Ivory; in length ſometimes nine, ten, twelve foot, or more; whoſe vertues are not inferior to thoſe aſcribed to the Land-Unicorn, as well in driving out the Meaſles and Small Pox, as in aſſwaging Malignant Feavers, and tough Diſtempers of Agues.</p>

This Agreement laſted till the ruine of <hi>Bagadat</hi> by the <hi>Tartars;</hi> ſince which they have diſpers'd themſelves almoſt over all <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> accounting all other <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> Hereticks, while themſelves by the vulgar are reputed Saints, though guilty of all manner of impieties: They Elect one High-Prieſt, whom they name <hi>Eloth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many other <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Sects, as the <hi>Cabaliſts, Sanaquites,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Seventy two Sects of <hi>Mahumetans.</hi>
                  </note> amounting in all to ſeventy two. By ſome all theſe are reduced to two: <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Laſhari,</hi> ſpreading over all <hi>Africa, Egypt, Syria, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Turky:</hi> And that of <hi>Imamie</hi> embraced over all <hi>Perſia,</hi> and in the City of <hi>Corazan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two Sects differ in many points, for the <hi>Arabian Laſhari</hi> maintain, that God is Author of good and evil: But the <hi>Perſian Imamie</hi> ſay, he is onely Author of good: The <hi>Perſians</hi> hold God onely to be Eternal; but the <hi>Turks</hi> ſay, the Law is ſo alſo: The <hi>Perſians</hi> believe, the Souls in bliſs ſee not God but in his works; whereas the <hi>Turks</hi> affirm, he ſhall be viſible in his
<note n="*" place="margin">That is, corporally, herein agreeing with the old Hereticks the <hi>Authropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphites,</hi> who aſcribed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane figure unto God, after which they conceived he created man in his own likeneſs.</note> Eſſence. The <hi>Perſians</hi> allow, when <hi>Mahomet</hi> received the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> his Soul was carried by the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> into Gods preſence: But the <hi>Turks,</hi> that his Soul and Body were both ſo carried. The <hi>Perſians</hi> pray but thrice a day: The <hi>Arabians</hi> five times, beſides many other differences about the interpretation of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56692:32"/>
                  <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as may be read in <hi>Camerarius, Bovius,</hi> and others; which for brevity we omit.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Mahomet</hi> contrived deſigning his Foundation for this (as they call it) his Law, appears in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> wherein ſpeaking of Chriſt, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Goſpel, and himſelf, he ſays; That <hi>God, Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> wrought Miracles before men. And in another place; <hi>The Word of God, Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>was ſent by the Creator of the World, to be the face of all people in this, and the Ages to come.</hi> Elſewhere he confeſſes, <hi>That Chriſt is the power of God, the Word, Wiſdom, Soul, Breath, and Heart of God, born by a Divine inſpiration of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>that he raiſed the Dead to life, made the Blind to ſee, the Lame to go, and wrought many other miracles. That he was more excellent than all the Prophets, and that the Jews had no more Prophets after him.</hi> He prefers <hi>Jeſus</hi> before all men and Prophets, and <hi>Mary</hi> above all Women; but averreth withall, that the
<note n="*" place="margin">The Hereſie of the <hi>Anthropomorphites.</hi>
                  </note> Traitor <hi>Judas</hi> was Crucified in ſtead of Chriſt, being changed into his likeneſs, and apprehended in his likeneſs in the Garden. Speaking of himſelf in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he uſeth theſe words, <hi>That he did no miracle, nor ſhould; that he was ignorant of moſt things; that he was a meer man, though ſent and inſpired by God, and could not forgive ſins.</hi> He forbad people to worſhip him; confeſſing that the truth of ſome things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in his Books may be doubted. He acknowledges the power of the Goſpel, in that he calls in a <hi>Light,</hi> a <hi>Guide,</hi> and <hi>Perfection;</hi> And much diminiſhed the Authority of his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>Every one that worſhippeth the true God, and liveth honeſtly and uprightly, be he</hi> Jew, Chriſtian, <hi>or</hi> Saracen, <hi>ſhall obtain mercy and ſalvation.</hi> His Diſciples believe the Creation of the World, that <hi>Adam</hi> was made of earth, all the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Hiſtories, and Chriſts Doctrine in part; They acknowledge a Reſurrection of the Dead, the laſt Judgment, Rewards, and eternal Puniſhment in Hell; and that Chriſt ſhall ſit next to God in judgment, which are points ſo ſeemingly conſonant to the truth, that weak Chriſtians miſtaking thoſe general notions, think it no great error to ſubmit to it; but all thoſe fair ſhews and formal ſpecies are quickly overthrown and daſh't to pieces by <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s aſſuming too much to himſelf, where he ſaith that Chriſt had profit by him in theſe words; <hi>I declare unto you from the Meſſenger of God who ſhall come after me, whoſe name is</hi> Mahomet, <hi>that is written from eternity, in the ſight of Gods Throne, on his right hand:</hi> 'Tis true, he commends <hi>Moſes</hi> highly, and owns <hi>Chriſt</hi> greater than <hi>Moſes,</hi> but himſelf the greateſt of all. He further adds, that the Chriſtians have corrupted the Goſpel, and the Jews the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> But yet both together makes up the ſame, and as much truth as is in his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> That he was ſent and directed by God, to ſettle his Law by force of Arms, but Chriſt in the power of Miracles.</p>
               <p>At eight years of age,
<note place="margin">Circumciſion.</note> the time of their Circumciſion, the Children ride to the <hi>Moſque</hi> with a Turbant on their heads, and a Torch carried on a Spear before them. After the Circumciſion, the Child by the Prieſts direction ſaith aloud, <hi>La Illah Illella Muhemet re ſul Allah,</hi> that is, <hi>God is one God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>his Prophet;</hi> and ſo after ſome Prayers and Offerings, returns.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law contains eight Commandments; The firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to acknowledge one onely God, and but one Prophet. The ſecond contains the Duty of Children to their Parents. The third, the love of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors one towards another. The fourth, the times of their <hi>Sala,</hi> or Prayer in the <hi>Moſque.</hi> The fifth, their annual Faſts, by all to be obſerved thirty days. The ſixth, the love and alms to the Poor. The ſeventh, of Matrimony. And the eighth, againſt Murther.</p>

               <p>A Paradiſe of all pleaſures is promi'sd to the obſervers of theſe commands; but for the Offenders a Hell with ſeven gates is prepared, wherein they ſhall eat and drink liquid Fire, be laden with Chains, and puniſh'd with hot ſeething Water.</p>

<note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>Zealand.</hi>
                  </note> Sea-land) ſtretching along that arm of the <hi>Nile</hi> that extends to <hi>Damiata</hi> and <hi>Tenez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is very fertile and luxuriant in the production of Rice and all ſorts of delicious Fruits: The ſecond yields plenty of Corn, prickle Fruits, ſtore of Cattel, Fowl, and Flax. And the third abounds with Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes, Cotton, and other ſuch Commodities.</p>
               <p>The whole thus divided into three; each three is ſub-divided into ten; as follows, in <hi>Delta</hi> or <hi>Nether Egypt,</hi> were <hi>Rakotites, Phtenuti, Phtemphuti, Mende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, Omiſis, Saities, Attribis, Tavites, Tarbethites, Buſirites;</hi> which order and names were firſt conſtituted by <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> (of whom it is recorded, that he would by cutting the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> between the <hi>Mid-land</hi> and <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> have joyn'd them, had he not been diverted from the attempt by their Prieſts aſſeverations,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56692:36"/>That all <hi>Egypt</hi> would of neceſſity be drown'd by the irruption of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> which lay higher than that Countrey did) though afterwards <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and others his Succeſſors, made great alterations therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Middle Egypt,</hi> held <hi>Memphites, Heliopolites, Bubaſtites, Heracleopolites, Crocodilopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Oxyringites, Kynopolites, Hermopolites, Antinopolites,</hi> and <hi>Latinopolites.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of this diviſion may be two-fold, the firſt in regard of their diverſities of Gods, and various Ceremonies in their Services, which <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> their Prince obſerving, to prevent tumultuous Seditions, alotted the Countrey into
<note n="*" place="margin">Rather thirty ſeven, for the reaſon in the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Labyrinth.</note> thirty ſhares, according to the number of their Gods and Goddeſſes, and by this means made <hi>Egypt</hi> as it were one Univerſal Temple, wherein were as many <hi>Numens,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> hath divided the whole earth between.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe was the Litigiouſneſs of the people, concerning their bounds or limits, occaſioned (as <hi>Strabo</hi> obſerveth) by the <hi>Nile</hi>'s yearly inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, whereby boundaries were not onely obſcured, but even all Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks and diſtinctions of propriety utterly waſhed away; which neceſſitated an infinite trouble in Annual Surveys; this was ſetled by the afore-mentioned diviſion, each particular Governour apportioning to himſelf even by inches the Compaſs of what was committed to his charge.</p>
               <p>This diviſion of <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> totally differed from that made afterwards by <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi> and by his Succeſſors eſtabliſhed (after the decay of that State by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> under the conduct of their King <hi>Cambiſes</hi>) which was into forty <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſties:</hi> But this, with the remains of all the reſt, were at laſt by the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> who trampled all down, utterly ſubverted, yielding to the Laws and Eſtabliſhments of the inſulting Conqueror.</p>

               <p>In bredth, as <hi>Marmol</hi> reckons, it hath but twenty ſix <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miles, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable tract of Land between the ſhore of <hi>Nile,</hi> and the two great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart Mountains, from whence the River with wonderful ſwiftneſs iſſueth, and thence deſcending to <hi>Aſne,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Alcayro,</hi> having ſcarcely run a courſe of twenty Miles beyond it, divides it ſelf into two Arms, which afterwards re-unite, till having run ſixty Miles beyond <hi>Alcayro,</hi> it branches again into two ſtreams, the one call'd the <hi>Canopean,</hi> paſſeth to <hi>Roſetta,</hi> and the other to <hi>Damiata,</hi> where by a new diviſion, cauſing a great Lake, through a narrow Streight, it falleth into the <hi>Mid-land Sea,</hi> near the place where of old <hi>Teneſſe</hi> was ſcituated.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56692:37"/>leſſen'd by <hi>Maginus,</hi> to three hundred, whereas on the other hand <hi>Villamont</hi> will have its Circumference to be ſeven hundred Miles, ſetting down a great Lake at the Coaſt of <hi>Garbia,</hi> Eaſtward from the River, for one part of its Limits; and another Channel of the <hi>Nile</hi> called <hi>Katoz,</hi> that goes to <hi>Alexandria</hi> for a ſecond. And this might cauſe <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to ſtile it <hi>Great,</hi> and ſub-divide it into the leſſer and third <hi>Delta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Antients (as <hi>Kircher</hi> obſerves) named this part <hi>Fium,</hi> which in the old <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tongue, ſignifyed the Sea: not from its reſembling the Sea in the time of its being over-flow'd; but becauſe it is generally believed that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole ſurface of that part was totally covered by the Sea, until by a long Series of time, the Slime and Mud of the <hi>Nile</hi> came to ſettle, and at length with great labour, became firm Land. The ſame <hi>Kircher</hi> in his <hi>Itinerary</hi> from a certain <hi>Rabbi,</hi> affirms, that from the Patriarch <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s time, many Hebrew Monuments, and old great Buildings were found there; and that after many dayes toyle and labour, by him directed, the ſame was made fit to be, and was actually inhabited, according to which example, ſucceeding Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually drayning the Marſhy parts, made the whole Countrey uſeful; which thereupon became ſo populous and wonderfully fertile in all things, that it was named, <hi>The Gift of the Immortal Gods,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus</hi> relates. And the Poets tell us of a great Serpent bred hereabouts, which did much miſchief to the people, till ſlain by

               </p>
               <p>This proof of <hi>Delta</hi>'s lying under water heretofore, makes us rightly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>Herodotus, Strabo,</hi> and others, who maintained all <hi>Egypt</hi> to have been in the ſame condition; whereas they muſt be underſtood by a Synechdoche, to have taken a part for the whole, for that <hi>Egypt</hi> in general was not drown'd with the Sea, will appear from hence, that it was very Mountainous, and upon a continual aſcent upwards to the <hi>Nile,</hi> even as far as the <hi>Cataracts</hi> thereof, and <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>

               <p>This famous River thus ſeverally known by variety of Names, by yearly inundations, doth ſo fertllize and fatten the earth, that it provides for and furniſhes the Inhabitants even with an exuberance of Plenty; which proceeds from three remarkable Prerogatives, wherewith Nature hath endowed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other Rivers: The firſt is, that he ſends forth no foggy vapors, which makes the Air very healthful and ſerene, being continually free either from Rain, Clouds, Miſts, or Fogs: Secondly, he runs with ſo even and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed a ſtream, that there never accrews any danger from his Waves or Billows to any Boats, Barks or Paſſengers ſailing thereon, but a ſatisfactory pleaſure from his continual calm: Laſtly, his faecundating vertue, which is ſo great, that it cauſeth not onely an infinite encreaſe in all ſorts of Cattel that water there; and breeds a prolifick faculty in Men and Women, but produces of all things growing from the earth a Harveſt plentiful even to admiration. And this fertility without diſpute was the cauſe why <hi>Egypt</hi> of old exceeded all other Nations almoſt, for multitude of people, and yet to this day, after ſo many direful depopulations, may compare with thoſe that boaſt the greateſt number of Inhabitants: As a teſtimony whereof, <hi>Diodorus</hi> records, that there were once in it eighteen thouſand ſtrong Cities; many of which, as it ſeems, were either by Time or War lay'd waſte and deſolate, becauſe we find in the Reign of <hi>Ptolomy Lagus,</hi> onely three thouſand Regiſtred, no more then remaining: which by <hi>Suidas</hi> his account, was in the Empire of <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus,</hi> when <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> lived.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author reports, that in Elder times, the number of its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were ſeventeen hundred thouſand; and that in his own time, they were no leſs in general eſteem, than thirteen hundred thouſand; which wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful encreaſe might be effected by the conſtant drinking the water of this River, whoſe vertue had the power as ſome believed, to make the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Women bring forth ſo often, not onely two or three, but ſometimes ſix or ſeven, nay eight Children at a Birth. And this may a little abate the wonder how the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in ſo ſhort a time as two hundred years (
<note n="*" place="margin">Broughton.</note> which was all the ſpace they ſojourned in <hi>Egypt</hi>) multiplyed from but ſeventy ſouls, to above ſix hundred thouſand men on foot, beſides Women and Children; nor may thoſe ſtupendious Monuments of Grandeur, which even to this day bear the name of <hi>Wonders,</hi> ſeem ſo ſtrange to have been erected by the Antient Kings of this Countrey, as a Remonſtrance of their glorious Greatneſs and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, if we lay into the other Scale the infinite number of people that were under their Commands; all whoſe hands at the Princes <hi>Fiat</hi> being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, made things otherwiſe ſeeming impoſſible to become facile; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of the Poet, <hi>Multorum manibus grande levatur opus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe unuſual Excellencies, and rare Qualifications of this River, the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> made it one of their chief <hi>Numens,</hi> which they worſhipped with particular Solemnities, under the name of the Goddeſs <hi>Iſis,</hi> to whoſe care and kindneſs, they aſcrib'd their continual freedom from the terror and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56692:38"/>of Earthquakes; and that they were never infeſted with any Peſtilential Contagion, but alwayes enjoyed a Serene wholeſomeneſs of Air, not ſubject to any impetuous ſtorms or alterations of weather, either from the Clouds or Windes: This was the cauſe of thoſe many honorable Epithetes beſtowed on it by Antiquity; among which, one was <hi>the flowing of</hi> Oſiris, or rather as <hi>Abenefius</hi> an <hi>Arabick</hi> Writer hath it, <hi>Oſiris Arm;</hi> becauſe it did as it were reach forth to Mankind ſo great a Plenty of Proviſions: For obſerving that <hi>Egypt</hi> encloſed with Mountains, did reſemble an Arm, and that the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions at the end, ſeemed Fingers, he appointed to the <hi>Nile</hi> the place of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi> or <hi>Liver-vein;</hi> This like that in the body, ſending forth its quickning moiſture, by whoſe motion and circulation, it fertilitates the whole even to ſuch an height of abundance, as makes Wonder ſtand amaz'd, to ſee Nature turn Prodigal. This agrees well with the Antient Poets, who gave to this River many notable attributes: <hi>Homer</hi> the Prince of them, ſays it fell from Heaven out of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Boſome; from whence happily ſprung the belief, not onely of the old <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but the later <hi>Greeks,</hi> that Heaven was its Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: This made ſome term him, <hi>The Gift of</hi> Jupiter; others, <hi>The Tears of the Gods; The Veins of Paradice; The Seed of the Gods; The Pond of</hi> Proteus; <hi>The Husband of the Goddeſs</hi> Iſis, and a number of other titles of remark not unknown to the remoteſt Nations: So that the more ignorant <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Negroes,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently entitle it <hi>Ankaata Mazat Schamatarri,</hi> that is, <hi>The Fountain of Heavenly Water:</hi> The <hi>Arabian</hi> Poets <hi>Hunfarid</hi> and <hi>Eldeburge,</hi> ſtile it <hi>Giatellartim, The life of the Earth:</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Iſaac Voſsius</hi> excellently well confutes this diſcovery of <hi>P. Pais;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Volſius.</note> ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by <hi>Kircher; For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thoſe pits on the ſhaking plain, as all others, are undoubtedly repleniſhed by Rain, without which the whole Globe of the earth would become barren and unfit for habitation.

                  <hi>Kircher</hi> in his Enquiries upon this ſubject, firſt makes the natural ſcite and diſpoſition of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Mountains a prime, and the condition of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, a ſecond cauſe; but after coming more home to the point, he gives two more probable. One, when their mouths are ſo obſtructed, they cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Water; Another, when the Channels receive more than they are wont or can contain. This later happens either through molten Snow, or the falling of exceſſive Rain. <hi>Thales</hi> one of the ſeven <hi>Grecian</hi> Sages, aſſerts the former opinion; <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and moſt other Philoſophers, the ſecond; and in truth the belief that the increaſe of Rivers proceeds from violent Rains, hath obtained the greateſt credit, being manifeſt not onely in Countreys lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the North-Pole, but even in Mountainous parts, under the Line, ſuch as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56692:39"/>great Rains come not from the Clouds, driven thither by annual Windes, but from thoſe exhaled in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> it ſelf, which are ſo much the greater as the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams there in a perpendicular line, have the greater vigour to attract, for which reaſon at the Suns coming out of <hi>Gemini,</hi> the matter cauſing <hi>Nile</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow is onely preparing; but when the Sun enters <hi>Cancer,</hi> then the <hi>Nile</hi> and other Rivers paſs over their Banks; among whom the great <hi>African</hi> River <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> then paſſing between mighty Mountains in <hi>Weſt-Ethiopia,</hi> diſchargeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Ocean.</p>
               <p>With this of <hi>Kircher,</hi> agrees <hi>Odoardo Lopez,</hi> ſaying,

               <p>The reaſons of the overflowing of <hi>Nile</hi> being thus ſhewn, <hi>Kircher</hi> ſtarts up two new Difficulties, <hi>viz.</hi> Why the mentioned Rains fall, the Sun paſſing the Northern Signs, and not at any other time? The ſecond, Why the Rains which fall in the <hi>Moors</hi> Countrey do not cauſe the ſame overflowing? Or why <hi>Egypt</hi> onely in the overflowing of <hi>Nile</hi> ſhould ſo much participate of it, as to ſeem no Land, but all Main Sea?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">As to the firſt, it is to be obſerv'd,
<note place="margin">Why the Rain falls in the <hi>Moors</hi> Countrey, when the Sun is in the North.</note> that a conſtant effect cannot be produced without a certain and conſtant cauſe; Now the Poſition of the Sun, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Scituation of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Mountains, are the chiefeſt and greateſt cauſe of theſe Rains, and the overflowing of <hi>Nile</hi> and ſome other Rivers; for wiſe and provident Nature hath made theſe Mountains (eſpecially thoſe between the Equinoctial and the Winter Tropick in 22 degrees of Southern Latitude, and which encompaſs the Southerly <hi>Ethiopia</hi> on the Eaſt, South and Weſt) to be as hollow, or concav'd Burning-glaſſes, which lying to the Sun in his Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Latitude, fitly gathers and ſo concenters his Beams, that they reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſuch a fiery heat, as makes extraordinary Exhalations, by which, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of thick Clouds are conſequently engendred, which crouded and thruſt together by the Trade-windes, at that time always Northerly, and beaten towards the capacious Receptions of the aforeſaid Mountain Convexities, are diſſipated thence at length by the fervent cold deſcending from the tops of the Hills, and ſo are diſſolved and come pouring down in hideous Showres, or rather in Streams, Floods, or Rivers of Rain, from whence it appears that Nature hath ſet them as Receptacles of Vapors and Clouds: for how much the ſcituation of Mountains, not onely in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> but alſo in other parts of the World, conduce to the breeding of Windes and Rain, is not ſtrange to any who have made ſearch into Natural Cauſes.</hi>

For as the Channels of Rivers running between the ſides of Mountains are deeper, ſo they can ſwallow the greater quantity of waters, becauſe the Mountains hinder their overflowing and running away: On the other ſide, where the Channels are ſhallow, and go through flat places and wide extended Grounds, with Banks low, the more overflowing they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to: The great Mountains therefore pouring down waters between their narrow Openings and Precipices into the <hi>Nile,</hi> makes it flow far and near over its ſhallow Channels, not able to contain that abundance; And for this reaſon all the flat Grounds in the <hi>Moors</hi> Countrey are ſubject to the like <hi>Nilian</hi> overflowings: As therefore the natural Scituation and Poſition of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which are ſo conjoyn'd, as we before ſaid, and the Plains ſurrounded by

               </p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why theſe Rains fall when the Sun is in the Northerly Signs,
<note place="margin">Why it rains when the Sun is in the Northern Signs.</note> muſt be attributed to Annual Winds, call'd by the Portugueſe <hi>General,</hi> or <hi>Trade-Windes,</hi> which at the Suns entrance into <hi>Capricorn,</hi> come bluſtering out of the North, and turn the Clouds to Rain; but when the Sun paſſeth <hi>Libra,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary Windes coming from the Ocean, and Countreys full of Snow in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellanica,</hi> being very cold, the Vapours not exhaling is the Cauſe, there is there at that time conſtantly bright and clear Weather.</p>

               <p>This Plant ſhoots forth upon ſtrait, round, and hairy Stalks, where from one and the ſame joynt grow two Leaves, one ſmall, the other great, having long Stalks beſet with whitiſh hairs: The Leaves in ſhape reſemble <hi>Louſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed,</hi> and different from thoſe of <hi>Bammia</hi> onely in bigneſs: The Flowers are almoſt like the <hi>Bammian,</hi> and ſhoot forth between the Body and Stalk of the Leaves, ſucceeded by round blackiſh Cods, which include a ſmall, black, bitteriſh Seed, ſmelling as ſtrong as Musk.</p>
               <p>The whole Plant is hot almoſt in the firſt degree, having a ſlimy Moiſture;
<note place="margin">The uſe of it.</note> the Leaves boyled in water, and applyed in form of a Plaiſter or Pultiſs to a Wound or Sore, though it makes the party faint and weak, yet hath good Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Of the Seed which is more hot and drying, are made Purging Pills for Women to ſuppreſs the riſing of the Mother; But put upon the fire, and the vapor taken up into the Body, draws down the Menſtrua.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Cairo,</hi> and in many other places of <hi>Egypt,</hi> grows the <hi>Tamarinde Tree,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tamarinde.</note> which in brief, (although the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> is the proper Countrey thereof) for its manifold uſes in <hi>Egypt,</hi> we will here deſcribe.

               <p>This Tree is as big as the <hi>Dameſin Tree,</hi> full of Branches,

               <p>Theſe Leaves, which fall not off in Winter, are ſomewhat ſharp, and not unpleaſant to the taſte, us'd to kill the Worms in Children: Moreover the ſame infuſed a Week in Spring water,

                  <note place="margin">An Obelisk or Pyramid, near <hi>Mattarea.</hi>
                  </note> where the ruines of <hi>Heliopolis</hi> are yet to be ſeen, ſtands in a great Lake a ſtreight Obelisk or Pyramid, with ſeveral Hierogli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks upon all its ſides; to which none can come on foot, but when the Water that from the overflowing of the River <hi>Nile</hi> falleth into this Lake, is dryed up by the heat of the Sun.</p>
               <p>Who was the Erector of this Pyramid is a difficult task to finde out,
<note place="margin">Who erected them.</note> though we may gueſs it to be one of the eight built, according to the relation of <hi>Pliny,</hi> in <hi>Heliopolis:
<note place="margin">Pliny.</note> Afterwards</hi> (ſays he) <hi>other Kings erected Obelisks or Pyramids, in the City of the Sun,</hi> viz.

There is no curioſity of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip in them, aiming onely at firmneſs, not ſo much to make them plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the eye, as to preſerve them from decay, and that they might endure even to a perpetuity, wherein they have anſwered expectation, theſe Structures, having outſtood Ages already, and without doubt may yet continue many Ages more, for ſuch is the firmneſs of the Materials, and the Stony ground, upon which they ſtand together with their Spiring, that they are preſerved not onely from all injury of weather, but made free from Earthquakes.</p>
               <p>The three firſt and greateſt very handſomly deſcribed by Prince <hi>Radzovil,</hi> and <hi>Peter Belloon,</hi> are ſeen in the way to <hi>Cairo,</hi> together with many other, ſtanding about twelve thouſand paces from <hi>Nilus,</hi> on the Weſt ſide in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a barren and ſandy Plain. Mr. <hi>Greaves</hi> from <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, theſe three are very conſpicuous to thoſe that Sail upon the <hi>Nile;</hi> they are ſeated on <hi>Africa</hi> ſide upon a rocky and barren Hill, from the <hi>Nile</hi> leſs than four, from <hi>Memphis</hi> ſix Miles.</p>
               <p>¶ THe firſt and greateſt Pyramid, according to <hi>Belloon,</hi> hath on every ſide at the ground from one corner to the other, three hundred and fifty paces: If we imagine the ſquare ſides of the Baſis, four equilateral Triangles mutually propending, till they all meet on high, as it were in a point; then we ſhall have a true notion of the juſt Dimenſions and Figure of this Pyramid; the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of each Triangle comprehending 2079 feet, and the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Baſis 2772. whereby the whole <hi>Area</hi> of the Baſis (to proportion it to our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures contains 480249. ſquare feet, which make 693. by the Engliſh Standard; eleven Engliſh Acres of ground, according to the Meaſure taken by Mr.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56692:63"/>the Stones of this ſtupendious Fabrick are of one bigneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> three foot long, and two foot broad and thick.

From hence is a moſt excellent and delightful proſpect of the Sea and whole Countrey, far and wide, yielding great ſatisfaction to the beholders.</p>
               <p>In the mid'ſt of it is an Arch'd Entrance,
<note place="margin">The form of it within.</note> conſiſting of eight great thick Stones cut with ſingular curioſity, and cloſe cemented together to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all beholders; From this Entrance proceeds a fourſquare Paſſage like a Well to the mid'ſt of the Pyramid, where the Corps for which it was erected, was put:
<note place="margin">A ſteep way.</note> This way goes down ſloping ſo ſteep, that it is ſcarce paſſable, which the Egyptian Kings did to preſerve their Burying-places from violence, and that the Dead might remain undiſturb'd: The Door where theſe bodies lay, was very neatly clos'd up with great Stone like the reſt, in ſuch manner that none could ſee or finde it without breaking up the Pyramid.</p>
               <p>This way is not to be paſſed without Torch-light, there being no Windows or Loop-holes to let in the light, deſcending almoſt two hundred paces, cut out between four even ranges of Stones, each five and twenty or thirty hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls broad, whereof one row makes the Vault; the other the floor, and the two remaining, the ſides of the Walk.</p>
               <p>At the end of this way,
<note place="margin">A Chamber at the end of it.</note> which is ſo low, that whoever goes in, muſt ſtoop, is a ſmall Chamber, wherein the weary Viſitors commonly reſt and eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for the continual ſtooping and difficulty of breathing in this cloſe place, cauſeth no ſmall faintneſs: Nor is there any freſh Air, other than what they find there; nor light, than that of the Torches they carry; ſo that the narrowneſs and the heat, which is no leſs there than in a Stove, cauſes a faint ſweat on all that enter.</p>
               <p>Out of this Chamber runs up another way,
<note place="margin">Another ſteep way.</note> by a very ſteep aſcent, wherein is a Vault, after the manner of Italian-Vaulted Stairs, arch'd over. 'Tis ſquare, and made of great and ſmooth Stones, the upper ſticking out a little beyond the lower, till by degrees they almoſt meet, leaving only a ſmall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: This way they climb up by Stones, that ſtick out in ſeveral places, upon which laying their Hands, and ſetting their Feet in gaps made on purpoſe, each diſtant ſix hands bredth from the other, the Viſitants with incredible la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor and pains creep up.</p>
               <p>At the end of this ſteep way is another Chamber with a lofty Roof,
<note place="margin">Another Chamber with a Burying-place. <hi>Piramidographia Mr. Greaves,</hi> pag. 94.</note> and a Burying-place therein, ſtanding acroſs the mid'ſt: This Room according to Mr. <hi>Greaves,</hi> is ſeventeen feet and
<note n="*" place="margin">190 parts of 1000 of a foot.</note> ſomewhat more broad; and thirty four feet and
<note n="†" place="margin">380 of 1000 parts of a foot.</note> three inches long, cover'd with ſeven very great and large Marble Stones, which with the corners and ſides, lying one againſt another, make a flat Roof: The Grave lyeth open without any Tomb-ſtone, as if it had been broken up, or rather never had been cover'd, becauſe the Inhabitants ſay,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56692:63"/>the Kings who built this Pyramid, were not Inter'd there: There is in that Chamber, a very great Tomb, cut out of one entire Marble Stone, hollow within; ſuch <hi>Beloon</hi> calls <hi>Theban</hi> Stones, ſo hard and firm, that they cannot be broken by any force; but being ſtruck upon with a Hammer or another Stone, it ſounds as loud as a great Bell; Some that have ſeen theſe Stones, ſay they are hollow within, four fingers thick, twelve hand-bredths long, five broad, and five and a half deep.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Pyramid is much leſs, having no ſteps on the outſide,
<note place="margin">The ſecond Pyramid.</note> ſo that men cannot climb upon it. At a diſtance theſe leſſer Pyramids, ſtanding on the advantage of an higher ground, ſeem greater; but the contrary is experienced as you approach nearer: This, as the firſt, is ſquare with a pointed Spire ſo ſharp, that one man cannot ſtand upon it: The North ſide hath ſuffer'd much by the unkindneſs of the weather.</p>
               <p>The third is much leſs than the two firſt,
<note place="margin">The third Pyramid.</note> upon which appear no ſigns of decay: It is a third part bigger than that ſtanding upon the Hill <hi>Teſtaceo</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the way from <hi>Oſtia:</hi> The whole Structure ſtands yet ſo handſome and undefaced, and free from cracks or flaws, as if it were new made.</p>
               <p>Not far from the greateſt Pyramid appears a Head of a wonderful form and greatneſs: Antient and Modern Writers call'd it <hi>Sphynx; Herodotus,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Sphynx.</hi>

               <p>Writers concerning this Structure, feign wonderful things; as firſt, that it gave Reſponſes to Inquirers like an Oracle; though many ſay, the Prieſts feigned and delivered them in manner following: They made a way under the Earth to the Belly and Head of it, by which going into the Image, they ſpake at ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out of the Head, whatſoever they would, giving anſwer to ſuch as came to ask Councel in difficult matters: The inward hollowneſs or cavities were
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56692:64"/>made with ſuch ſubtilty, that the Voice therein finding no other paſſage than the large gaping of the Mouth, firſt rumbling, at laſt with great force burſt forth, whereby the credulous Heathens, who ſtood before it ſilent and amazed, took it for no leſs than the voice of a Deity, and by that extraordinarily led on to the adoration of it.</p>

               <p>The Entrance of this Pyramid lyes open from the upper part downward, but the way within is ſo ruinous and choak'd up with Stones, that it is ſcarce paſſable without creeping, which to the Viſitors, becauſe of the falling down of other looſe Stones, often proves dangerous.</p>
               <p>Below there appears a very ſpacious and high Chamber, appointed as they ſay, for a Burying-place, in which is a little Door opening into another as large Chamber, built after the ſame manner: Neither of theſe have any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Corps, either perhaps becauſe none were there Buried, or elſe the Burying-places are totally defaced: Out of theſe two Chambers, wherein a decayed Gate lyeth, goes a riſing way, not to be aſcended without a Ladder, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the people ſay, is a Burying-place.</p>

                  <p>The two leaſt are of an incredible bigneſs, yet exceeded by the third, which is ſaid to have in height, breadth, and length, three hundred Cubits; It hath within artificial and broad Steps, by which you may, as alſo by Steps without, climb to the top; There are likewiſe places fit for Viſitants to retire and eaſe themſelves in, two whereof more large were the Burying-places of the Kings; in the lower of which there ſtands yet extant a very great Sepulchre.</p>

<note place="margin">The firſt and greateſt Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid.</note> The greateſt of them is built of quadrangular ſtones, riſing <hi>Inſtar Montis,</hi> like a Mountain, by ſingular Art: and although it appear in a ſquare form all along to the very top, yet theſe four-ſquare ſtones are ſet in ſo uniform an order, that the whole Structure ſeems to repreſent the form of a Picked Hill: The going up, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the thickneſs and bigneſs of the ſtones, is difficult and toylſom, yet feiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for though I my ſelf uſed a competent endeavor, I could not in an hour and half aſcend to the top, which is flat, and ten Cubits on each ſide.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Pyramid is a little leſs than the firſt,
<note place="margin">The ſecond Pyramid.</note> and about two Bowes ſhot from it, without any entrance into it: On the out-ſide you may climb half way up, the ſtones being ſo fitted on purpoſe, as in the former, but a little leveller and ſmaller: Near the middle way they lye ſo even, that it is impoſſible to climb any higher; and this ſmoothneſs which ſeems to be done on purpoſe, reaches to the height of ſeveral cubits, which if it could be paſſed, from thence to the top, being one third part of the Pyramid, the ſtones lying careleſly and uneven, you might as well be able to climb up to the top of it, as of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Pyramid.</p>
                  <p>The third lying next <hi>Cairo,</hi> was erected, as we ſaid, by <hi>Rhodope,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The third Fyramid.</note> made wholly of ſloping ſtones, ſo that there is no climbing up: Three Bowes ſhot from it on the one ſide toward the City ſtandeth a Head, ſuppos'd of that Concubine,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56692:65"/>with a long Neck and large Arms, ſeven Cubits high, and cut out of one entire Stone. Some imagine that out of the firſt great Pyramid which we entred, by a hollow Paſſage under ground through a firm Quar, which we ſaw arch'd over with ſtone, a ſmall and ſecret Entrance came into this Head, and from thence (ſo is the common fame) by the mouth of that Head Oracles delivered.</p>

               <p>The whole Image repreſents the Goddeſs <hi>Iſis,</hi> together with the tutelar Gods: The ſeven trailing Streams upon the Breaſt, ſignifie the ſeven Planets: By the Bodies cover'd with a Cloak or Garment like a Net, is imported that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by hidden and hazardous adventures, makes Life a Snare, and full of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling puzzle and continual ſtruggle: The Image of a Woman with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched Arms ſignifyeth the Egyptian * <hi>Jynx:</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>Upon a piece of a great gilded Winding-ſheet that lay flat upon the <hi>Mummy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Deſcription of the <hi>Mummy</hi> of a young Man.</note> was the ſhape of a young Man in a long Veil of fine Linnen, as the antient <hi>Egyptians</hi> uſed to be cloth'd, artificially repreſented, and all over from head to foot delineated with Hieroglyphicks: The Head was cover'd with a Wreath of Gold and Pretious Stones, under which black-colour'd Hair appear'd; in like manner the Beard was black and curl'd, but ſmall: On his Neck he had a Gold Chain, with a piece of Coyn like a Single-penny on his Breaſt, ſuch as the Governors of Provinces in <hi>Egypt</hi> wore formerly, whereupon the Bird <hi>Ibis,</hi> with ſeveral obſervable Marks were pourtrayed, which ſeems to import that this young Man had been of quality in his time: He held in his right Hand a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cup with red Liquor, for a token of preſenting the Drink-offering, and in his left Hand a Fruit not unlike a <hi>Malacatoon,</hi> with a Gold Ring on the fore and little finger: He had on his naked Feet black Sandals laced on: On the Girdle was a Fillet whereupon was written <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Woman that lay in the ſame Cave,
<note place="margin">The Pourtraiture of a Woman.</note> was without doubt the Wife or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the young Man, and more ſumptuouſly drawn upon her Herſe-cloth; Beſides ſeveral other Hieroglyphicks, there ſtood upon gilded Plates two Fowls and two Lions, back to back, and upon another Garment lay an Ox or Cow, perhaps the Image of <hi>Apis</hi> or <hi>Iſis,</hi> that Idol by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in that ſhape. Upon another Plate hanging to the laſt link on the Breſt, the Sun was pencil'd: In the Ears were Gems with Garters on her Arms and Legs, and many Rings on her Fingers: In her right Hand ſhe held a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Water-pot, and on the fore-finger of the left Hand a Ring, with other Trimmings and Ornaments: She had, as the young Man, black curl'd Hair, which cover'd her Face; dark and thick Eye-brows, with black Eyes wide open: Theſe Effigies or Reſemblances were drawn with a rough hand, like Pictures in unſetled and barbarous times.</p>
                  <p>In the Cave wherein the two fore-mention'd <hi>Mummies</hi> were found, there were other Corps which lay all without order, buried in the Sands, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd onely by its drineſs. Beſides the former two, there was another which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56692:69"/>lay in a Woodden Coffin with a Virgin carv'd upon it, and laid forth almoſt like the former, with a gilt Herſe-cloth and other Ornaments. In the broken Body of this Virgin, was found nothing elſe but a great many Rollers and <hi>Bitumen</hi> wound up therein, for the Bones and Fleſh were in a manner dried and conſumed, ſo that it ſeemed to be onely a ſhell of Wood. The Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the <hi>Mummy</hi> were ſo hard, that a Hammer could ſcarce make any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon it: A little forwarder other Corps were to be ſeen in great number, wound up in ſingle Clothes, and preſerv'd in common <hi>Bitumen,</hi> without gilt Coverings, Pourtraitures, or any other Ornaments; whence may be concluded, that the adorn'd Bodies were Perſons of rank and quality, either of Prieſts or Great Miniſters of State, which onely had hope to come to the future Dominion, as <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus,</hi> and other antient Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers mention.</p>

                  <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith in his * ſecond Book,
<note place="margin">Herodot.

               <q>
                  <p>After mourning for the Dead, they bring the Body to be embalmed,
<note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> for which ſeveral perſons are appointed excellently skilled in that Art, who when it is brought into the houſe, ſhew wooden Images of other dead perſons painted in natural colours: Firſt, the neateſt, afterwards courſer, and then a third the courſeſt of all, asking according to which they will have the Corps done: After a bargain ſtruck, having the Corps there, the <hi>Pollinctors</hi> embalm the Body with great diligence in this manner: Firſt, with a crooked Iron they drill the Brains out of the Head through the Noſtrils, upon which they ſtrew Medicinal Ingredients; After that with a ſharp Stone had out of the <hi>Moors</hi> Countrey, they open the Belly and take out all the Bowels, which being cleanſed and waſhed with <hi>Phenician</hi> Wine, are mixed with pounded Spices: Then they fill the Cavity of the Belly with beaten <hi>Myrrh, Cynamon, Incenſe,</hi> and other the like <hi>Aromaticks,</hi> and ſo ſtitch it up again; this done, they lay it ſeventy days in Salt, and no longer; After which the Corps are waſh'd, and wound up in ſilk Blankets cut in ſlits, and ſpread over (like our Sear-clothes) with a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56692:70"/>Gum which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> uſe in ſtead of Lime: When the Friends have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Corps thus Embalmed, they frame a Wooden caſe juſt fitted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they lay the Corps, and put it into the Burial-Cave next the Wall: Thus ſumptuouſly they prepare and order their Dead.</p>
                  <p>There is another kind of Embalming us'd by thoſe of the middle ſort,
<note place="margin">The ſecond ſort of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming.</note> being of no great coſt, <hi>viz.</hi> They fill a Syringe with Gum of Cedar-wood, and inject it through the Fundament into the Belly, without removing the Bowels, then let the Corps lye ſo many days as aforeſaid, in Salt: On the laſt day they ſqueeze out the injection by the ſame way, which hath ſuch an Operation, that it brings with it what is not fit for Preſervation, and the Salt conſumeth the fleſh; ſo that nothing but the Skin and Bones of the Dead remain, which finiſh'd, the the Corps is delivered up to the Friends, without any more coſt or trouble.</p>
                  <p>The third way uſed to the poorer ſort is onely this:
<note place="margin">The third ſort of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming.</note> they cleanſe and waſh the Belly firſt, and then lay the Corps ſeventy days in Salt, and ſo finiſh the <hi>Obits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ladies of Quality are not ſo ſoon expoſed to the Operation of Embalming, nor ſuch as were famous for Beauty, becauſe the Embalmers ſhould not abuſe their yet untainted Bodies: for they ſay, one of theſe

               <p>They that erected Obelisks in honor of the Sun,
<note place="margin">Why they do ſo.</note> whoſe beams their ſpiring tops ſeemed to repreſent, would not take every kinde of ſtone, but ſuch onely as did moſt analogize with that glorious Body, which in their opinion this Marble doth: By nature it conſiſted of a four-fold Exiſtence, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, a gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering Red, among which here and there are found ſome mixed, other clear Chriſtal-colour'd Spots; then Violet-colour, after that Blew and Aſh-colour, with ſome ſtreaks or daſhes of Black between; which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſeeing, they choſe it, as moſt fit to repreſent their hidden Myſteries; ſo that by the aforeſaid Mixture of the Colours, without doubt they intend to ſignifie the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and particularly by the Red, <hi>Fire;</hi> by the Chriſtaline, <hi>Air;</hi> by the Blew; <hi>Water;</hi> and laſtly by the Black, the <hi>Earth.</hi> Hereby appears with how great judgement the <hi>Egyptians</hi> choſe fit Materials for their Myſteries, and that for the better repreſenting their deep Notions, they have us'd nothing but what might make them more conſpicuous. And if any find older Obelisks of another
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56692:74"/>ſort, certainly they were not true <hi>Egyptick;</hi> but either erected by Strangers, in imitation of the true; or in the late times, when by the Deſtruction and Baniſhment of the Prieſts by <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> the Sacred <hi>Egyptian</hi> Letters were utterly loſt. Such was the Obelisk rais'd by the <hi>Phenicians</hi> to the Honor of the Sun; which being depreſſed, low, flat, and leaning, very much differ'd from the right: Such a one alſo <hi>Herodian</hi> ſays, the Emperor <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> brought from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi>

The Buds or Bloſſoms are very like the Primroſe ſmelling well, eſpecially early in the Morning; ſo that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> delight to walk under their ſhade. Every Bloſſom hath in the mid'ſt of it many ſmall Strings, which at length become great, and turn thick Trunks or hollow Pipes, which ripen all the year long, and at all times continue hanging on the Tree.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> gather theſe Pipes at <hi>Cairo,</hi> onely in Summer time, when many other green ones appear out of the Bloſſom, which at length, as the firſt, grow dusky.

               <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> keep this Fruit the whole year good, in Cellars, which as a rarity they ſet upon the Table for Strangers to eat.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Dadel-Tree</hi> (of which there are Male and Female) hath every other year abundance of Fruit, but the Female affords no Fruit, unleſs her Branches be plaſh'd with thoſe of her Mate. Many to make the Female fruitful,

But <hi>Veſlingus</hi> ſeems to reject this,
<note place="margin">Obſervat. in Alpin.</note> aſcribing the great fruitfulneſs of it to the Soil, being Sandy and Nitrous: For he affirms that he hath ſeen the Earth in the <hi>Dadel-Tree</hi> Wood oftentimes, thick cover'd with a white Down or Callow, like Cellar Walls where we finde our Saltpetre, which by the ſultry South windes from <hi>Negro-land</hi> and the Barren <hi>Arabia,</hi> is in great abundance driven up hither, and falling on the tops of the <hi>Dadel-Trees,</hi> not onely makes them flouriſh, but alſo pregnant.</p>
               <p>The Roots are ſo ſmall, thin and ſhort, that it is a wonder how it ſupports it ſelf, being ſo great, eſpecially when ſo often charged by ſtrong &amp; aſſiduous guſts; for contrary to other Trees, this tapers downwards, and the ſlendereſt part of the Stock is neareſt the Foot, which hath made ſome ſuppoſe that the Plant, though large, receives no nouriſhment from the Earth by the Root, but from the Air.</p>
               <p>There is no Tree more profitable, or turns to a greater account than this: for of the Stock or Body they make Beams and Rafters for Floorings of Houſes, and of the Boughs and Branches they make divers ſorts of Wooden Ware, which they call <hi>Cuffaz.</hi> Of the Leaves, Sayls and Mantles; and of the Bark they make Tow and Cordage for Ships. The Fruit affords not onely a moſt delicious Food, but good Phyſick. The <hi>Arabians</hi> as we ſaid, call this Tree <hi>Dachel;</hi> a Bough of it with <hi>Dadels</hi> on, they call <hi>Samarrhich;</hi> the Bag or Cod, <hi>Dux;</hi> a young un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe <hi>Dadel, Tella;</hi> a greater, <hi>Nin;</hi> one half ripe, <hi>Ramich;</hi> perfectly through ripe, <hi>Bellan;</hi> a dryed one, <hi>Tamar;</hi> a rotten one, <hi>Rotob;</hi> and the Leaves, <hi>Zaaf.</hi> In the Stock where the Branches ſhoot out, lyes a white Bag full of Pelp or Juice; which many, when a Tree either falls or is cut down, pull out, and eat raw, as a provocative to <hi>Venus;</hi> it not differing much in taſte from our <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choaks.</hi>

<note place="margin">Joſephus.</note> that when <hi>Moſes</hi> drew into the Field againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> through places beſet with Serpents, he took theſe Birds along with him, ſhut up in Paper Cages.

This Creature firſt taught the uſe of Cliſters and Syringes; for with the crooked Bill, as with a Syringe, it injects Salt-water into his own Bowels, to open its vent when obſtructed: and from thence, ſays the ſame <hi>Elian, Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> took that Chyrurgical Practice.

<note place="margin">The Egyptian Hawk, or rather the Eagle, drinks no water.</note> becauſe of the ſimilitude of Nature which it hath with the Soul, drinketh no water, but blood, whereby they imagine the Soul to be nouriſh'd. In their Hieroglyphical Writings a Hawk repreſented God, partly becauſe above all other Fowl it ſeems to be the Image of the Sun, being obſerv'd out of a peculiar and hidden power of Nature, to look with very fixed Eyes upon its Beams, and for that cauſe they ſometime pourtray the Sun in the form of a Hawk.</hi> Thoſe who had willingly or unwillingly kill'd a <hi>Hawk,</hi> or the Bird <hi>Ibis,</hi>

               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:56692:84"/>
               <p>¶ THe Air, eſpecially about <hi>Cairo,</hi> and further towards the South,
<note place="margin">The Air in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Hot.</note> becauſe ſo near the Line, is when the Sun caſts his Beams perpendicularly from <hi>Cancer,</hi> very Hot; during which time of violent Heat, all the people dwell in places under ground; and in <hi>Cairo,</hi> in the midſt of every Houſe, are Wells containing water, which not only cools their Manſions, but refreſhes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They contrive alſo in their Houſes very great Pipes or Funnels, which ſtand right up into the Air, from the midſt of the Houſe, with a broad Mouth like a Bell, ſtanding open to the North, wherein the cool Air en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, is ſent down to the lowermoſt retiring Rooms under Ground. For ſhade alſo in the Streets, every Dwelling hath a broad Penthouſe: And for refreſhment of their ſcorched Bodies they uſe bathing, for the commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereof they have curious Bannia's of ſweet and clear Water from the River <hi>Nile,</hi> without mixing any Herbs or Medicinal Ingredients.
<note place="margin">The Hot Air is cooled by <hi>Nilus,</hi> and the Anniverſary Winds.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Heat alſo is ſomewhat moderated by the overflowing of <hi>Nilus</hi> at that Time, and the continual blowing of cool Northerly Winds; otherwiſe the Heat there is ſo vehement, that neither Man nor Beaſt could be able to live. In Winter, the Air is Hot and Dry, ſometimes a little cool, but generally very Hot, and moſt obnoxious to the Head of all parts of the Body. The Air of the Nights is cold, which after Sun-riſing becomes a little Warm; at Noon very Hot, but at Night again Cold: ſo that its inequality breeds many Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>¶ THe Year may alſo very well, though in a different way from us,
<note place="margin">The Seaſons of the Year are with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> fourfold.</note> be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into four Seaſons, The firſt is Spring,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April.</hi>
                  </note> in which the Weather is temperate. They have alſo every Year two Summers, but contingent, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into an unhealthy and intemperate, and a healthy and temperate.
<note place="margin">The firſt Summer.</note> The firſt being the unhealthful, continues to the middle of <hi>June,</hi> and the riſing of the <hi>Nile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Summer begins from the <hi>Nile</hi>'s riſing,
<note place="margin">The ſecond Summer.</note> and continues till <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and the Decreaſe. The Harveſt conſiſts of two other Moneths;
<note place="margin">Harveſt.</note> but the Brumall Seaſon beginneth on <hi>December,</hi> and continueth to <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Winter.</note> Thus is the Year divided, the Reaſon whereof we will a little ſearch after. Firſt, Then they placed the Spring, as before is ſaid, becauſe at that Time the Air is of a moderate and milde Temper, and the Trees begin to bud and grow,
<note place="margin">The firſt Summer cauſeth many Diſeaſes.</note> and the Ground to bring forth. The Spring ended, the firſt Summer begins, very hurtful both to Man and Beaſt; during the whole time of whoſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, very hot and tedious Winds blow, call'd by them <hi>Campſien,</hi> from <hi>Campſi</hi> a Commander, who was overwhelm'd under a great heap of Sand by theſe Winds, and ſmother'd with his whole Army in the Deſarts of <hi>Africa:</hi> Such is the violence of theſe impetuous Guſts, ſometimes, that it ſo raiſes the Sand, that for three, five, ſeven, or nine Days, the Air is darkn'd, and the Sun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeen for thoſe Atomy Clouds. At this time rage many mortal Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but chiefly Soreneſs of the Eyes, for the hot South-winds, as we ſaid,
<note place="margin">How this comes to paſs.</note> ſo drive up the ſcortching Sand, that they ſeem to bring with them ſhining Flames, the which driven through the Air, hurts and prejudiceth the Body, and in the Eyes breeds prickings and inflamations. And that time many mortal Feavers and Phrenſies rage, which diſpatch men in few Hours. In fine, all Bodies are thereby ſo Diſtempered, that they abhor Food, continually burning with unquenchable Thirſt, againſt which the Water of <hi>Nile</hi> is the only Remedy.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56692:85"/>Strangers all this Seaſon retire to places under Ground, where they remain till other cool North-winds ariſe from the <hi>Midland-Sea,</hi> which afford a preſent Comfort to their inflamed and afflicted Bodies, wonderfully cooling the Air.</p>
               <p>After this followeth the ſecond Summer, not ſo Hot, becauſe the Northerly Winds daily renew freſh and cooling Breezes, and the <hi>Nile</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows his Banks: What Alterations of Air happen, are not ſudden, but come leiſurely, and therefore it is a healthful and wholeſome Time.</p>
               <p>Now the Husbandmen live at Eaſe, becauſe the Ground, while covered with the <hi>Nile,</hi> cannot be either Plowed or Tilled, paſſing the Time in Shows, Sports, and other ſigns of Joy, with Feaſtings and Mirth. Then comes Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time and Harveſt at the Decreaſe of the <hi>Nile,</hi> in which are Wheat and other Fruits ſown, which becomes ſoon Ripe, and are ſuddenly Reaped. This Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is temperate and free from Sickneſſes: The following Winter-Moneths the Air is colder, and conſequently more wholeſom.</p>
               <p>It Rains ſeldom in the In-land Parts,
<note place="margin">It Rains ſeldom in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </note> and about <hi>Cairo,</hi> and what is, is rather a Dew or miſling than a Shower. At <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Damiata,</hi> and upon all Places lying near the Sea, are many times great Rains, but ſeldom or never is there any Ice, Snow, or Hail ſeen, becauſe the Air is not cold enough for it. This as to the Temperature of the Air.</p>
               <p>¶ NOw concerning the Temper and Conſtitution of the People,
<note place="margin">Several kinds of <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </note> you may obſerve three ſorts of Inhabitants in <hi>Egypt, viz.</hi> Citizens, dwelling in <hi>Cairo</hi> and other Cities; wandring <hi>Arabians,</hi> that live in Tents; and laſtly, Ploughmen or Husbandmen, which dwell up the Countrey. Moſt of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens are Sanguine, but the Bodies of the Ploughmen and <hi>Arabians</hi> are hot and dry, ſo are many Townſmen; but the continual drinking the <hi>Nile</hi> Water, often uſe of cooling Food or Diet, and the immoderate uſe of <hi>Venus,</hi> mightily leſſen and alter the Heat and Drought. Beſides, their continual uſe of Baths of ſweet Water, ſo cools them, that many of thoſe dry tan'd Complexions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Sanguine, eſpecially Women and Eunuchs. They have cold Stomachs, and full of Flegm, proceeding from the conſtant uſing of cooling Diet, as alſo by the over-great Heat of the Air, whereby the natural Heat extracted or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled, the Stomach is left Raw and Cold.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> are general very Groſs and Corpulent,
<note place="margin">The form of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> eſpecially the People of <hi>Cairo;</hi> moſt of the Men there being ſo Fat, that they have much Greater, Thicker and Larger Breaſts than Women; but the <hi>Arabians</hi> are Meagre and Slender, ſo are the Husbandmen, and not only ſo, but alſo hairy, ſweaty, and almoſt ſcorched and burnt by the Sun. They do all follow <hi>Venus</hi> immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they are by Nature very Wakeful, and little inclining to Sleep, of a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit, yet delighting in an Idle and Lazy Life; only the <hi>Arabians</hi> and Farmers take Pains, or elſe they muſt Starve.</p>
               <p>¶ THis Countrey is very ſubject to ſeveral and dangerous Diſeaſes,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Egypt</hi> is much ſubject to Land-Sickneſſes.</note> partly becauſe of the intemperate Air, partly by the immoderate uſe of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and partly becauſe the Poor there which are numerous, are neceſſitated to uſe foul unwholeſom Food, and muddy and corrupt Water. The chief Diſeaſes afflicting them, are Blear Eyes, Scabs, Leproſie, and Mortal Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Small Pox, pain in the Limbs and Joints, Ruptures, Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder, Conſumption, Obſtructions or Stoppings, Weakneſſes of the Liver, Spleen, and Stomach, Tertian Agues, Conſuming Quartanes, and all
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56692:85"/>manner of Maladies of the Head. It is true, other people are ſubject to the like; but not ſo continually, nor grievouſly, and therefore properly may be call'd <hi>The Plagues of Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in Harveſt-time many malignant and mortal Agues reign, by drinking the tainted and foul Water, which the Townſmen from year to year keep in their Wells under their houſes. In Winter they are troubled with ſore Eyes, but the Inhabitants of <hi>Cairo</hi> much more; among whom it reigns ſo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemically, that ſcarce half of them eſcape the Diſtemper. There alſo rages that moſt terrible <hi>Egyptian</hi> Diſeaſe, by the <hi>Arabians</hi> call'd <hi>Dem El Muia,</hi> which in few hours ſuddenly poſſeſſes the Brain like an Apoplexy, and bereaving them of ſenſe and underſtanding, in few minutes irremediably kills them. Every year once are the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſurprized with this Sickneſs, of which multitudes dye.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time Children are much afflicted with a malignant kind of Pox bred by the venomous Damps raiſed from the corrupt Water of <hi>Caleg,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malignant Childrens Fox in <hi>Alexandria.</hi>

               <p>The Peſtilence is very frequent in theſe Parts,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Egypt</hi> is much afflicted with the Peſtilence.</note> and prevails againſt them the more, becauſe they ſeek no Remedy for it, falſly conceiting, that God hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly appointed and ordained every ones Death aforehand, and the manner of his Dying; ſo that he that muſt die in the Wars, cannot die of the Peſtilence, and thoſe onely can die of the Peſtilence, that are aforehand deſtined of God for it. For this cauſe, as we ſaid, no <hi>Egyptian</hi> will go about to avoid the Place, nor ſhun converſe with the Infected: and the Clothes and other Houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff of ſuch as dye of that Diſtemper, are inſtantly ſold in the open Market by Out-cry, which none are afraid to buy: by which mad obſtinacy in this their fooliſh Perſwaſion, the Plague in <hi>Cairo,</hi> in the ſpace of ſix or ſeven Moneths, ſometimes ſweeps away above five hundred thouſand People.</p>
               <p>This dreadful Malady commonly begins in their firſt Summer,

               <p>That which begins in the firſt Moneths, is the worſt of all, eſpecially if it come over out of <hi>Barbary:</hi> for then it ſometimes almoſt depopulates whole Cities, leaving them deſtitute of Inhabitants: But if it comes later, it is ſo much the milder, and ceaſeth the ſooner. But although it rage never ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">At the Suns entrance into <hi>Cancer,</hi> the Peſtilence ceaſes in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </note> yet at the Suns entrance into <hi>Cancer,</hi> it wholly ceaſeth: which by them is accounted no ſmall Bleſſing: for from thence forward, as if never any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious Diſeaſe had been, the City and all things in it are from a depth of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable deſpair reduced into a ſecure, ſafe, and healthful condition: Neither while the Contagion laſted, did any other Diſeaſes appear among the People. Now the reaſon of this ſo ſudden Ceſſation ſeems to be cauſed by the even and conſtant temper of the Air,
<note place="margin">How this comes to paſs.</note> by the blowing of the Anniverſary <hi>Northwinds,</hi> which then begin to riſe and oppoſe the moiſt Nature of the <hi>South-winds,</hi> call'd as we ſaid, <hi>Campſien;</hi> which cooling as well the Air as Mens Bodies, taking away the Cauſe, (the infectious Heat) the Effect ceaſeth.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Peſtilence is always brought over from other Places into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </note> it follows that it is brought thither from other Neighbouring and Bordering Places; and eſpecially out of <hi>Greece, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Barbary.</hi> That which is brought thither out of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and falls upon <hi>Caire,</hi> is very milde, kills few, and holds but a ſhort time.

<note place="margin">Two ſorts of Tongues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </note> one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, underſtood by all in ordinary Converſation; the other Peculiar, onely uſed by the Prieſts, Prophets, and Religious Votaries, whoſe ambition led them to hopes of the Crown and Government of the Kingdom: This they nam'd <hi>The Sacred;</hi> but the <hi>Coptick</hi> or Vulgar, <hi>The Profane Tongue:</hi> Which laſt was alſo call'd, <hi>Pharaohs Speech;</hi> becauſe it was uſual in the time of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings, which were call'd by that one General Name of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> I ſhall in brief ſet down the difference and propriety of them both.</p>
               <p>Whence the Name <hi>Coptos</hi> or <hi>Copta</hi> took its Original, Writers diſagree.

               <p>Here we may take notice of a great miſtake among moſt eminent Writers,
<note place="margin">The difference between <hi>Coptos</hi> and <hi>Cophtos.</hi>
                  </note> who without diſtinction confound <hi>Coptos</hi> and <hi>Cophtos;</hi> whereas they differ much in their ſignification. <hi>Coptos</hi> is an antique word, and found in old Authors; but <hi>Cophtos</hi> is a Name invented by the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who call the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by way of deriſion <hi>Cophtites;</hi> as if they would ſay, <hi>Circumciſed.</hi> Some ſuppoſe they are call'd <hi>Cophtites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Della Valla.</note> becauſe they followed heretofore the Erroneous and Heretical Opinions of <hi>Eutiches</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> condemned in the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which did before Baptiſm uſe to receive Circumciſion; (for <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>The preſent <hi>Cophtick Tongue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Coptick</hi> is the old <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Tongue.</note> is not onely like the Antient <hi>Egyptian,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Pharao's,</hi> but altogether one and the ſame, as appears by ſome words ſtill in uſe; and among the reſt the Names of the Moneths, whereby the Old <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the Modern <hi>Coptiſts</hi> name them without any remarkable difference. The like you may obſerve in the Planets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mars</hi> was with the Antient <hi>Egyptians Moloch,</hi> which the Holy Scripture ſo often mentions;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Remphan</hi> in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlations.</note> 
                  <hi>Saturn, Refan,</hi> the very word uſed in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles; Venus</hi> is called <hi>Zahara:</hi> and many Plants and Herbs, mentioned by <hi>Apuleius</hi> in his Book <hi>of the Vertues of Herbs,</hi> may be found very little different from the preſent <hi>Egyptian</hi> Names. Now ſince no Tongue comes nearer to the old <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian,</hi> than the <hi>Coptick,</hi> we may rationally conclude, that the <hi>Coptick</hi> is the true and antient <hi>Egyptian,</hi> not ſo pure and undefiled indeed, as it was in the time of the <hi>Patriarchs;</hi> but by proceſs of time, the manifeſt mixture of People and Languages, and other alterations of the State diſguiſed and corrupted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Coptick</hi> in it ſelf is an Original,
<note place="margin">Its diſtinction from the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue.</note> not a Derivative Language, though ſome ſtrongly argue, that it is but a <hi>Greek Dialect,</hi> differing as the <hi>Caldee</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> It is true, that in <hi>Coptick Dictionaries,</hi> brought from <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Peter Della Valla,</hi> many words ſound like the <hi>Greek;</hi> but it is to be obſerved withall, that this Tongue had not that mixture at the beginning, but it fell in in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and the <hi>Ptolomys,</hi> by the mutual Converſe of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> together, for three hundred years. And by the ſame means alſo <hi>Latine, Arabick, Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Samaritane</hi> Words are blended with it; but this is not ſufficient to root out its Original Purity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſets down ſo great an Agreement between the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Egyptian Tongue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">From the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
                  </note> that he ſeems to maintain thoſe People might very eaſily have underſtood one another; but this contradicts that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which ſpeaking of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>When he paſsed into Egypt, he heard a Language which he knew not.</hi> Beſides, If there were ſo great an Agreement, it muſt have ariſen either by Trading or Converſe; of both which the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as the Scripture witneſſeth, were utterly debarr'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Geſner,
<note place="margin">And from other <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Tongues.</note> Volateranus, Euſebius, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſeem to aſſert, That the <hi>Egyptian Tongue</hi> hath ſome relation to the <hi>Abyſsine, Caldee, Arabick, Syriack,</hi> and other <hi>Oriental Languages,</hi> moved by a ſimilitude of Sound: and for that like the <hi>Hebrews, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Caldeans,</hi> they uſe Letters inſtead of Arithmetical Characters.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:56692:89"/>
               <p>But this Opinion ſtands upon a looſe Foundation; for there are great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between this and the other <hi>Eaſtern Tongues,</hi> as well in manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, as in Words: As for example; The <hi>Hebrews</hi> call Father and Son; <hi>Ab-U-Ben;</hi> The <hi>Caldeys, Abba-Ubra;</hi> The <hi>Syrians, Abo Vabro;</hi> The <hi>Arabians, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lab Vallabu;</hi> The <hi>Abyſsines, Vb Wawalda;</hi> The <hi>Armenians, Hor eu Ordi;</hi> The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans, Ab-U-ben;</hi> The <hi>Egyptian Copticks, Fiot Nemſiri:</hi> Hereby appears the great Agreement of the <hi>Eaſtern Tongues</hi> among themſelves; but not in the leaſt with the <hi>Coptick:</hi> for what likeneſs have the words <hi>Fiot Nemſiri,</hi> with <hi>Ab Uben, Abo Vabro, Ab Uben, Ab Wawolda,</hi> &amp;c.? Accordingly <hi>Theſeus</hi> concludes, That the Analogy of ſeveral Speeches in one or two words, makes no more to prove them the ſame, than that Stone and Timber are <hi>Identicals,</hi> becauſe both grow in the Earth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Coptick</hi> hath this peculiar Property; That all the Words thereof uſed by a Stranger, receive alteration in the firſt Syllable, and not in the terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ultimate, uſual in other Languages: Neither at this day are any Books remaining of it, onely a few words have been preſerved by <hi>Greek</hi> and other Writers of moſt Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Authors diſagree about their Characters;
<note place="margin">The Letters of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </note> however we have reaſon to conclude, that they were taken from the form and poſtures of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Beaſts, by them accounted Sacred; when they intended to ſignifie whatever in it ſelf is great. The minute or leſſer matters were expreſt by their ſeveral parts or members.</p>
               <p>As they endeavored in their holy Language to perform all their matters by Myſteries, ſo they did alſo in the vulgar <hi>Coptick,</hi> as will plainly appear by their Alphabet, conſiſting of two and twenty Letters: wherein few but ſignifies ſome deep Myſtery.

In like manner, under all the other Letters, according to their ſpecifical diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, lay hid other peculiar and deep Myſteries. Beſides this, they had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other manner of Writing: ſo that it ſeems the other were onely uſed as Sacred <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> to ſet forth great Secrets: As a Teſtimony whereof ſeveral <hi>Mummies</hi> have been found, upon whoſe gilded and gummed Winding-Clothes many <hi>Coptick</hi> Letters were inſcribed, being no ſmall evidence to prove the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity: becauſe the <hi>Mummies</hi> were Interred long before the Invaſion of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes,</hi> who deſtroyed or baniſhed the Prieſts, by which it was loſt, as we have often mentioned.</p>

               <p>Theſe <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> contain a compleat Sence, in what manner ſoever it be expreſſed, whether Beneath or Above, or on the Right or Left Side; for upon the Obelisks or Spires they ſtand perpendicular; upon Flats for Painting, they ſtand as we write, Level; but upon Rounds of Metal or Marble Statues or what other Repreſentations, they march ſtrait up or down, athwart or promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous without Order.

               <p>¶ THe Antient <hi>Egyptians</hi> obſerved onely a <hi>Lunar</hi> Year: But ſeeing this manner of Reckoning did not agree with their Affairs, but was diſcommodious, they brought it, according to <hi>Cenſorinus,</hi> from one to three Moneths, and after that to four. But here we muſt obſerve, all the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did not compute their Year according to the Courſe of the Moon: for a great part obſerved the <hi>Solar</hi> Year, but yet not the ſame that is now in uſe, for it contained no more than three hundred and ſixty Days, which they divided into twelve Moneths, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving each Moneth thirty Days.</p>
               <p>This Computation was a long while uſed, then at length growing skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler by experience in the Courſe of the Heavens, and the Suns Annual Motion; they added to the ſaid three hundred and ſixty, five more, which they call'd <hi>Niſi:</hi> which year afterward was generally received for the true Civil Year, and according to <hi>Horapolla</hi> call'd <hi>Gods Year:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> For the <hi>Egyptians</hi> call'd the Sun <hi>God,</hi> and therefore it is not ſtrange, that the <hi>Sun's Year</hi> by them ſhould be call'd <hi>The Year of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="365"/> Every four years with them conſiſted barely of fourteen hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Days: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But <hi>Gods Year,</hi> fourteen hundred and ſixty one Days. Then at length among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> the <hi>Civil Year</hi> was brought to the <hi>Solar</hi> or <hi>Sun's Year,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1460"/> that is, every Year was lengthened a quarter of a Day, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1461"/> that is, to three hundred ſixty five Days and ſix Hours; for in ſo much time the Sun finiſht his Courſe round the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> and the fourth Year, with the lengthening of one Day, by the putting together of the four-times ſix hours, made it a Leap-year: Now that the making a Leap-year in this manner was in uſe among the old <hi>Egyptians,</hi> among others <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> gives us to underſtand in theſe words,
<note place="margin">Diodorus Siculus.</note> where he ſays; <hi>That the days among the</hi> Egyptians <hi>were not reckoned by the Moon, but according to the courſe of the Sun; ſo that they gave every Moneth thirty days, and to the twelfth Moneth they added five days with a quarter of a day, that in this manner they might have a perfect courſe or circuit of the Year.</hi> And this among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> was ſo antient, that they had it long before <hi>Alexander the Great</hi>'s coming thither; not learning it from, but rather teaching it to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Eudoxus, Plato</hi>'s Diſciple, teſtifies: who having by Services and by great Study dived into this knowledge, taught it the <hi>Grecians</hi> in his own Countrey, as <hi>Strabo</hi> affirms.</p>
               <p>As the Year ſo ſettled was generally call'd <hi>Gods;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods year.</note> ſo was alſo every year of the four call'd by the name of one of the chiefeſt of their Gods: The firſt they call'd <hi>Sothis,</hi> or <hi>Thoth,</hi> that is, Dog; from the Dog-Star, for that they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56692:93"/>began their year at the riſing of that Star; The ſecond bore the name of <hi>Iſis,</hi> or <hi>Serapis;</hi> The third of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> and the fourth of <hi>Horus,</hi> which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> alſo call'd <hi>Kemin.</hi> Wherefore, when they would repreſent the four years, they made the Figure of <hi>Hermes</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> with a Dogs Face, ſtanding upon a Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile with a Bowl in his hand. At his right ſide <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> at the left <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis</hi> with a Figure of <hi>Nilus</hi> upon his head, and an Image of a Star, repreſenting according to <hi>Manilius, Iſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Coptiſts</hi> and <hi>Abyſsines</hi> keep the ſame reckoning, onely changing the names of the <hi>Heatheniſh Gods,</hi> into thoſe of the <hi>Four Evangeliſts;</hi> calling the firſt year <hi>Matthew,</hi> the ſecond year <hi>Mark,</hi> the third <hi>Luke,</hi> and the fourth <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this forementioned Civil and large year, for Civil affairs, there was by the Prieſts and Aſtronomers another current year in uſe, which they term'd <hi>The Myſtical Year,</hi> and conſiſted of three hundred ſixty and five days, bare: By which means, in four years they loſt one full day; and in forty years ten: Wherefore the time of their Feſtivals, inſtituted for the Honor of their Gods, every year came ſo many days earlier: For <hi>Geminus</hi> affirms, That the Feaſt of the Goddeſs <hi>Iſis,</hi> which in the time of <hi>Eudoxus</hi> fell in the <hi>Winter Solſtice,</hi> in his time came a whole moneth ſooner. This moveable Courſe of the Feſtivals was done by the Contrivance of the Prieſts, that they might not Celebrate them always upon one and the ſame time of the year; reſolving that they ſhould run through all the Seaſons: For the Gods, according to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in fourteen hundred and ſixty years make Progreſs over all Countreys and Places of the World, and paſs through all the Degrees of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and the days of the Moneth in proceſs of time, that no place of the World, nor part of year ſhould be debarr'd of their neceſſary preſence. Thus far of the Computation of the Year among the Old <hi>Egyptians.</hi>

               <p>There is a fourth Accompt uſed by the <hi>Abyſsines,</hi> and that is the Emperour <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s, introduced by him in the nineteenth year of his Reign, being the year of Chriſt, Three hundred and two: It begins the twenty eighth of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> Old, or the Eighth of <hi>September,</hi> New Stile, in the firſt Moneth <hi>Thoth.</hi> They call it in the <hi>Arabick,</hi> from the City <hi>Captos, Tarich Elkupti,</hi> that is, <hi>The Coptick Calendar;</hi> and by the <hi>Copticks, The holy Martyrs Calendar,</hi> or, <hi>The Year of Grace;</hi> and by the <hi>Abyſſines</hi> in that Countrey Language, <hi>Amath Mahareth,</hi> that is, <hi>The Year of Grace and Mercy;</hi> becauſe of the great Perſecution which the Chriſtians at that time ſuffered under the ſame <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> when about <hi>Coptos</hi> onely were Martyr'd an hundred and forty four thouſand. The reaſon of introducing which Accompt, we will in ſhort ſet down.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Diocleſian</hi> reign'd, ſeiz'd with a raging Fury, he not only inſulted with ſtrange arrogance over the Chriſtians, caſting them to wilde Beaſts, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing againſt them all other kinds of ſavage Cruelty; but endeavoured by all means to extirpate their Name, and to that purpoſe he put in practiſe, and commanded to deſtroy and burn up all their Religious Books, ſuppoſing when that was done, they would eaſily be brought to the practiſe of their <hi>Heathen Rites,</hi> and accordingly upon the twenty fifth day of <hi>March,</hi> being then <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56692:94"/>ſaid <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and his Colleque <hi>Maximian,</hi> commanded and publiſhed Edicts to that end, that all the Churches of the Chriſtians, in <hi>Egypt</hi> eſpecially, and about <hi>Thebes,</hi> ſhould be thrown to the Ground, and the Books of their Religion deſtroyed. And in the ſecond place, the antient manner of the Years uſed by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he made to be fitted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Stile, and that Account he named from himſelf, <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> in which laſt he ſo far prevailed, that it took place even among the Chriſtians, ſo long as Heatheniſm continued, and until the time of the Abbot <hi>Dionyſius.</hi>

After much Diſcourſe held on both Sides, and the Concluſion of the <hi>Beys</hi> Buſineſs, which continued about two Hours, he invited him to taſte a diſh of <hi>Sorbet</hi> and <hi>Coffee;</hi> which done, and he about to depart, the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> accompanied him three or four ſteps over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Door of his Chamber on that ſide of the Room where he gave audience; and then told him, That he had a Letter from the <hi>Grand Signieur,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Command to ſend him his Head, upon the penalty of his own, and without more words, <hi>Bey</hi> having no time to eſcape, was immediately taken and brought through the Gallery of the Room, by the ſide of the Place, where uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Water is to waſh himſelf; there was he beheaded, and the head inſtantly thrown through the Window of the Room upon the open Place, as alſo the Trunk or Corps through the Gallery of the <hi>Chiaus</hi> in the ſame Place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> a man of ſolid Judgment, and full of Courage, of the Age of five and thirty Years, withdrew himſelf without any tumult; but as ſoon as it was Publiſhed, he was ſurrounded with five or ſix Thouſand <hi>Janizaries,</hi> whom he ſatisfied with Reaſons. On the Morrow, the Great Men all aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in the Caſtle, and other Commanders, demanded of the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> the Order of the <hi>Grand Signieur,</hi> which he ſaid, he would not deliver to any but his Maſter, neither would he ſhew it. They threatned to take his Head in Compenſation for the other; to which with a ſetled Reſolution he neither anſwered nor reſiſted. However, he was convey'd out of the Caſtle, and kept under Guard till the <hi>Grand Signieur</hi> ſhould ſignifie his Pleaſure, either to diſcharge, or have him ſent to him.</p>
               <p>The Dominion of the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> is limited and bounded by Law; for without the <hi>Kadileſcher</hi> or Preſident of the Council, and the Great ones of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, he cannot conclude any thing of great Concernment; however he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56692:96"/>takes Cognizance of moſt things which happen to his Employment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſhaw</hi> in <hi>Cairo</hi> hath the like Officers under him, as are in other <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Places; that is, a <hi>Tihaia, Cadilesker, Sanjaks, Defterdar, Sarraks, Chiaus, Soubachi;</hi> all which together Conſtitute the <hi>Divan</hi> or Councel.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tihaia</hi> is the ſecond Perſon next the <hi>Bashaw,</hi> and the <hi>Cadilesker</hi> as much as Preſident of the Councel, or <hi>Divan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sanjaks,</hi> of which the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> is Head, are eighteen in number; they take Pay every Monday, and their higheſt Pay is five and twenty thouſand <hi>Medins</hi> a Moneth; beſides five and twenty <hi>Ardebes</hi> of Corn, and the like Weight of Barley.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Soubachi</hi> is as much as a High-Sheriff of a County.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Divan</hi> or Councel aſſemble at the Caſtle of <hi>Cairo,</hi> or in the Rooms of an old Structure joyning cloſe to the Caſtle, thrice a Week, on Mondays, Tueſdays, and Thurſdays; on Mondays uſually Matters of State, and that which concerns Juſtice are debated; and on Tueſdays touching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſhaw</hi> comes into the <hi>Divan</hi> at Noon, accompanied with the <hi>Defterdar,</hi> and four <hi>Sanjaks,</hi> which they call <hi>Nubba;</hi> after the diſpatch of buſineſs proper for the time, and calling over their Names, they leave the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> and the <hi>Def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdar</hi> alone with the Secretaries of the <hi>Divan,</hi> which ſit at the foot of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw:</hi> In this <hi>Divan</hi> alſo ſit the <hi>Roſmanegi, Mocategis, Calfas, Mocabelgies,</hi> and the <hi>Sarraf Baſſy,</hi> who commonly is a <hi>Jew,</hi> accompanied alſo with ſeveral other <hi>Sarrafs,</hi> Receivers of the Treaſures as well in <hi>Cairo,</hi> as in the plain Countrey in the <hi>Caſſifillis</hi> and <hi>Melteſcens,</hi> or <hi>Meltecemino</hi> that be Provinces.</p>

               <p>On Thurſdays the inferiour <hi>Divan</hi> aſſembles, where the <hi>Cadilesker</hi> ſits in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to hear the Complaints of the People, violently oppreſſed or fleeced by the <hi>Caſſifs,</hi> or Governours. But at this day theſe Courts are ſeldom kept, yet the people dare not complain.</p>
               <p>Concerning the peculiar Buſineſſes of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> they have their own particular <hi>Aga</hi> or Preſident, as alſo <hi>Spahies</hi> and a <hi>Chiaus;</hi> from which laſt all the Chief Officers proceed, and are Judges in all Differences which ariſe among them: from whom however there is an Appeal to the <hi>Divan</hi> of the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> which yet is ſeldom done. Buſineſs of ſmall moment, that reach not Corporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, are decided by the <hi>Cadizen</hi> of State; but Corporal Puniſhments are inflicted by the <hi>Sanjak,</hi> or Superior Authority.</p>
               <p>All the Differences among Chriſtians in <hi>Cairo,</hi> or between <hi>Chriſtians, Turks, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> are determined by the Conſuls of their own Nation, there reſident.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sanjaks</hi> of <hi>Cairo</hi> ſuperintend ſeveral high and mighty Affairs both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without the Countrey; that is, one conducts the <hi>Caravan</hi> from <hi>Cairo</hi> to <hi>Mecha;</hi> another guards the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Revenue to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> a third at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Muſter-Maſter General in the Affairs of the Souldiery, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Rolls againſt <hi>Perſia, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Mecha.</hi> When they have finiſht their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, they are diſcharg'd for three years following.</p>
               <p>Four other <hi>Sanjaks</hi> uſually keep Guard in <hi>Grand Caire</hi> Moneth by Moneth, upon the four great ways of the City: The firſt is <hi>Alladelne,</hi> or the Gate, out of which they go to <hi>Suhez,</hi> the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine:</hi> The ſecond, that over

               <p>¶ THe Religion of the Antient <hi>Egyptians</hi> conſiſted in the worſhipping of Idols,
<note place="margin">The Antient Religion or Worſhip.</note> Beaſts and other Creatures, under the ſeveral Names of <hi>Oſiris</hi> and <hi>Iſis, Serapis, Apis, Hammon, Canopus, Horus, Harpocrates, Mithres, Typhon Oſiris</hi>'s Brother, and others beſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oſiris,</hi> according to the Teſtimony of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> was the Son of <hi>Saturn,</hi> after whoſe Deceaſe married to <hi>Iſis.</hi> They ſay he govern'd <hi>Egypt</hi> with ſuch Wiſdom and Moderation, that he infinitely gained the affections of all: For beſides the wholeſome Laws he made, he inſtructed them in Husbandry, Mechanick-Trades, Planting of Vines and Olive-Trees; and was the firſt among them, that by the help of <hi>Mercury</hi> taught them Letters.</p>
               <p>Theſe happy Inventions thus perfected, <hi>Oſiris</hi> thirſting after greater Glory, raiſed a great Army, and commending to <hi>Iſis</hi> the Care of all, to whom he joyned as an Aſſiſtant for Councel, <hi>Mercury,</hi> a moſt Ingenious and Politick Stateſman;
<note place="margin">Hercules Egyptian.</note> and Commiſſioned <hi>Hercules,</hi> a man of extraordinary Strength and Power to overlook the more Active and Military Part. When he had order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all thus wiſely, he aſſociated to him his Brother <hi>Apollo,</hi> and his two Sons, <hi>Anuber</hi> and <hi>Macedo;</hi> thus marching into the Field, accompanied alſo with <hi>Pan, Maro,</hi> and <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> the firſt Planters of Vineyards, and Sowers of Corn, he paſſed through <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> atchieving many great Victories, and teaching Civility to all thoſe barbarous conquer'd Nations: At laſt touching upon <hi>Europe,</hi> much improved by his Travels and Warlike Expeditions, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Egypt;</hi> where for theſe great Acts he was Deifi'd by the People, and Worſhipped as the Sun, and his Royal Conſort <hi>Iſis</hi> as the Moon: becauſe as their idolatrous and dull Fancies imagin'd <hi>Oſiris</hi> aſcended into the Sun, and <hi>Iſis</hi> into the Moon, to preſide and govern the two great Luminaries, and ſo conſequently the Earth.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Diodorus</hi> relates, That when <hi>Typhon</hi> ſaw his Brother <hi>Oſiris</hi> while alive thus highly reverenc'd, his heart was ſo imbitter'd againſt him, that he privately murther'd him by the help of the <hi>Tytanois</hi> diſtributing to every one of his Relations a part of his Body, and uſurped the Kingdom. But <hi>Iſis</hi> with the aſſiſtance of her Sons <hi>Horus</hi> and <hi>Anubis,</hi> ſoon reveng'd her Husbands Death, by the deſtruction of <hi>Typhon,</hi> and all his Rebellious Complices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſis</hi> after this in memory of her murther'd Lord, with Herbs and Wax wrought or kneaded with <hi>Aromatick</hi> Spices together, framed a moſt Exquiſite Effigies of him; commanding the Prieſts to ſhew it every one, with order that they ſhould in ſecret honour him as a God, and Conſecrate to him what Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they liked beſt: And the more to promote this Service, ſhe ſettled on them a Yearly Revenue; which prevailing on their covetous minds, they inſtantly put all in practice, in manner following.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:56692:97"/>
               <p>The Prieſts at the appointed time Went into the <hi>Archives</hi> of the Temple, where ſtood (but known onely to them) this Image of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> before which in mournful poſtures, amidſt their contrite and moſt doleful lamentations; they firſt ſhaved their Heads, then beating their Breaſts, and ripping up the Scars and new-heal'd Orifices of their former Wounds received in private as a preparation for this general Service. Some days in this manner being paſt, they pretend by a moſt wonderful, and divine Inſtinct, to have found the Body of <hi>Oſiris;</hi> whereupon they run out from Sorrow to the extremity of Exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; Tears and Lamentations turn to Songs, Dances, and all ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels: Which Solemnities finding applauſe with the ignorant Vulgar, after the firſt Sanction were continually after Celebrated at the Feſtival ſet apart for the finding of <hi>Oſiris</hi>'s Body.</p>
               <p>There was another Feaſt, call'd in <hi>Greek, Phallophoria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Feaſt <hi>Phallophoria.</hi>
                  </note> kept in Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the finding his <hi>Genitals;</hi> for <hi>Typhon</hi> had, as we ſaid, diſtributed the reſt; which <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſays was publickly preſented in Ivory or Gold, half a yard in length, carried about with Wind-Muſick, and in dancing before it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented all wanton and obſcene poſture. <hi>Iſis</hi> alſo had a Holiday, wherein they did nothing but bemoan <hi>Oſiris</hi> Death. At all theſe Feaſts, the Prieſts wore a long white Linnen Surplice, they wore upon their Head the Image of <hi>Anu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> headed like a Dog, in their Right Hand a Branch of Sea-Wormwood, or Pine; in the Left, a Tree that had power (as they gave out) to drive away Evil Spirits. <hi>Oſiris,</hi> according to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> draws the <hi>Etymology</hi> from the <hi>Greek</hi> Word <hi>Hoſieros,</hi> or <hi>Hoſiros,</hi> that is, <hi>Very Holy;</hi> or of two <hi>Egyptian</hi> Words, <hi>Os</hi> and <hi>Iris;</hi> the firſt ſignifying <hi>Great</hi> or <hi>Immenſe;</hi> and the laſt an <hi>Eye;</hi> as much as to ſay, as <hi>Great Eye. Kircher</hi> will have it, that <hi>Oſiris</hi> in the Antient <hi>Egyptian Tongue</hi> ſignifies <hi>Holy Lord,</hi> and a <hi>Ubiquitary Fire.</hi> If then <hi>Oſiris</hi> genuinely denotes a <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Light,</hi> or an <hi>Immenſe Eye,</hi> it muſt needs be meant of the Sun; becauſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers held the Sun to be a Fire. And we not ſcruple to denominate it <hi>Great Eye,</hi> viewing ſtill at once the half of our <hi>Orb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſis, Oſyris</hi>'s Wife was alſo taken for the Moon; both theſe were ſaid, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Diodorus,</hi> to compaſs the World, and to feed and multiply all things, by a continual Circulation. Theſe are peculiarly operative in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagations; the one being Fiery and full of Spirit, the other Moiſt and Cold; the Air which is the Nurſe, participating of both.</p>
               <p>The Powers and Perfections of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> or the Sun, are expreſſed by ſo many Names, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> not without good cauſe calleth it <hi>Myrionumos;</hi> that is, <hi>Thouſand Names.

                  </note> And <hi>Bellonius</hi> in his Obſervations, ſays, The <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> do keep their Law much more ſtricter than the <hi>Turks;</hi> and although that have prevailed moſt, yet in <hi>Cairo</hi> it ſelf, are many Chriſtians, of ſeveral Nations and Sects, <hi>viz. Engliſh, Dutch, French, Italians, Copticks, Neſtorians, Maronites, Georgians, Jacobites, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Syrians,</hi> and others, amounting to the Number of 100000. All which, though in ſome Points differing among themſelves, yet in many of their Church-Ceremonies they agree with the <hi>Roman,</hi> though in others they have remarkable Differences: They inhabit ſeveral Cities, Villages, Hamlets and Cloiſters beſide <hi>Cairo,</hi> as at <hi>Alexandria, Sai, Tmui, Aſna, Feſtadada, Coptus, Aſman, Aſioch, Eleſmunin, Monphaluth, Caus,</hi> and in the Cloiſters of St. <hi>Macharius,</hi> St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> St. <hi>Hermes,</hi> and St. <hi>Pachomius,</hi> adjacent to the Red-Sea.</p>
               <p>All theſe Chriſtians, and the <hi>Abyſsines</hi> themſelves, are under one Patriarch, who keeps his Reſidence in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and in the <hi>Arabick</hi> is call'd <hi>Papa,</hi> or <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Patriarch,</hi> that is, Our Father Patriarch.</p>
               <p>In former times, under the Perſecution of the Emperor <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> the <hi>Copticks</hi> did lead an Honeſt and Sincere Life, adhering to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards rent from it, by the embracing the deſtructive Hereſies of <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> and <hi>Eutiches;</hi> and at preſent own no other Head of the Church than the <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian Patriarch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> hold, that in Chriſt, by the Hypoſtatical Union,
<note place="margin">

Copt. c.</hi> 2.</note> is one only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Nature, conſiſting of two Natures not Perſonal, without Mixture grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together. They make Saints of <hi>Dioſcorus, Severus, Petrus, Macharius,</hi> all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and condemn <hi>Pope Leo.</hi> They hold alſo, that themſelves, together with the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Abyſsines,</hi> are the Univerſal or Catholick Church, and exclude all others, and withal, that before the General Judgment, no man goes into Paradiſe or into Hell.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that follow the Hereſie of <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> from <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Kircher.</note> deny Chriſt's Humanity, affirming his Body coequal with the Deity; others deny that he received a Soul, and from theſe words of St. <hi>John, And the Word became Fleſh;</hi> that he took Fleſh of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and that meerly the Word became Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Thoſe laſtly, that follow <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> a <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Biſhop,
<note place="margin">Kircher.</note> diſtinguiſh
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56692:99"/>two Subſtances or Beings in Chriſt, giving him two Perſons, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence two Sons of God, and two Chriſts; one which is God, and the other generated of his Mother <hi>Mary.</hi> They ſay that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> is not to be call'd <hi>Gods Mother,</hi> but <hi>Chriſts Mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In their Divine Service, the <hi>Copticks</hi> uſe the Liturgies of St. <hi>Peter, Mark, Baſil, Gregory, Cyril,</hi> tranſlated into the <hi>Coptick,</hi> they alſo Celebrate it in <hi>Arabick,</hi> which there every one underſtands; but the Epiſtles and Goſpels are read twice, once in the <hi>Coptick,</hi> and once in the <hi>Arabick;</hi> In the ſame manner as in a Solemn Service at <hi>Rome,</hi> they are read both in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> At the time of the Service, they all leaning againſt the Pillars, thereby to ſhew, that they are Travellers or Pilgrims, and expect the bleſſed coming of the Glory of the Great God. They ſing aloud altogether their Liturgies, in a Tone call'd in <hi>Arabick, Hink;</hi> ſometimes raiſing their Notes to the <hi>Alts,</hi> then uſing deep <hi>Cadences,</hi> ſo well ordered, that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing Diſcord jarr from their Harmony.</p>
               <p>Now although moſt of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Patriarchs or Paſtors, together with their Flocks have formerly thus departed from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the whole <hi>Abyſsine Church,</hi> have, and ſtill do acknowledg the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Doctrine to be the right, and the Pope to be Chriſts Vicar; as appears by ſeveral Letters from <hi>Gabriel</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſent by two Meſſengers to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, in the Year Fifteen hundred ninety and three; wherein he calleth himſelf <hi>GABRIEL, The humble Miniſter by Gods Grace, of St.</hi> Mark, <hi>in the City of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and in all other, bordering Southerly on the Sea-coaſt, and among the Abyſsines.</hi> In one of theſe his Meſſages he made Confeſſion of his Belief before the Pope, in theſe words: <hi>I believe and confeſs that the holy</hi> Apoſtolick Seat, <hi>and the</hi> Roman Pope, <hi>is the ſupream Head in the whole Church, and the Succeſſor of the bleſſed Apoſtle St.</hi> Peter, <hi>Prince of the Apoſtles, and Chriſts Vicar, and Father and Teacher of all Chriſtians: I confeſs that Power is given to him from our Lord Chriſt, through St.</hi> Peter, <hi>to keep and govern the Univerſal Church, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that none can be Saved out of that Univerſal Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Confeſſion, which they ſtand to at this day. The Pope is by theſe Patriarchs, in their Letters to Him, commonly thus Entituled:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the Greatly Eſteemed</hi> Pope, <hi>Father of the Prieſthood, Succeſſor in the Univerſal, Apoſtolick, truly Believing Church, Father and Prince of Princes, Chriſts Vicegerent on Earth, Sitting upon the Seat of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>Prince of the Apoſtles, Lord</hi> Urban <hi>the Eighth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Death of one Patriarch, another is choſen out of the number of Monks, reſiding in the Cloiſters.</p>
               <p>And here obſerve, That ever ſince the Beginning of Chriſtianity, there were three Patriarchs, by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> Erected in the moſt Famous Cities of the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> The <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> and the <hi>Antiochian;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to afterwards was added the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan,</hi> by the Councils of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> And laſtly, the <hi>Jeruſalemitan,</hi> by the ſame Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> held in the Year after the Birth of Chriſt, Three hundred twenty and five, annexed to the Patriarch of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, Egypt, Lybia,</hi> or <hi>Pentapolis, Arcadia</hi> and <hi>Auguſtanica;</hi> to which afterward were added Upper and lower <hi>Egypt,</hi> both <hi>Thebes,</hi> and other, ſo that at laſt <hi>Egypt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd ten Arch-Biſhopricks: For ſo many Metropolitans it pleaſed the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valentinius</hi> to call together out of this Patriarchat, in a Letter to <hi>Dioſcorus.</hi> And indeed ſo far hath this of <hi>Alexandria</hi> extended it ſelf of late, that now it includes the utmoſt Bounds of the <hi>Abyſsines.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:56692:99"/>
               <p>There are in <hi>Egypt</hi> likewiſe many <hi>Calogers,</hi> that is, ſhaved Monks, which follow the <hi>Greek Religion,</hi> and poſſeſs many Churches and Cloiſters. All which live poorly, ſleep upon the Ground, and drink no Wine, but meerly ſo much as is neceſſary for the Maſs.</p>

               <p>¶ THe Cuſtoms of theſe People are according to their Names,
<note place="margin">Every man marries ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wives.</note> 
                  <hi>Barbarous:</hi> For every man takes as many Wives as he pleaſes, keeping beſides Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines and Slaves in great number. They eſteem the Children of one Woman no more than the other; all after the Fathers Deceaſe joyntly participating of the Inheritance.</p>
               <p>In their Marrying they uſe no other Solemnity, than a bare Teſtimony and Aſſurance, which the Bridegroom makes before the <hi>Cadi</hi> or Judge; whereby he acknowledges to take ſuch a
<note n="*" place="margin">As we had in the late Troubles, Marriages before a Juſtice.</note> Woman or Maid for his Bride: but this is of ſo little validity, that he may put her away when he will: Neither hath the Woman a leſs Priviledge, having liberty at her pleaſure to renegue her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, onely with this difference: If the Wife go from her Husband, yet the Father is bound to pay him the Marrige-Portion promiſed: But if the Man puts away his Wife, he can demand nothing, except he have teſtimony againſt her for Adultery. The Women and Maids keep themſelves ſo vail'd, that they are not, nor muſt be ſeen by ſuch as would make Love to Marry them.</p>
               <p>In like manner the Men are ſo Jealous of their Wives, that they dare not go open-fac'd to their Parents.</p>
               <p>They have many pernicious Cuſtoms,
<note place="margin">Evil Cuſtoms.</note> being greatly addicted to Sorcery and Witchcraft: Whoever at any time falls ſick, makes an addreſs to a Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Wiſe-woman, as we term them, who oftentimes cure them by Charms taken out of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> or <hi>Amulets,</hi> or elſe Specifick Medicines, for they have neither Phyſician, Apothecaries, or other Druggiſts, but onely ſome inexpert Chyrurgeons.</p>
               <p>The greateſt Zealots amongſt them, when ſick, go where one of their <hi>Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,</hi> or <hi>Saints</hi> lie buried; to whoſe Sepulchre they bring a great many things to eat, fondly fancied to a belief, that if by chance a Beaſt eat thereof, it gets the Diſeaſe, and the ſick perſon will recover.</p>
               <p>When their women are in Labor,
<note place="margin">Great Superſtition of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> when they bring forth.</note> they ſend to School to fetch five little children, whereof four are employ'd to hold the corners of a Cloth, in each whereof they tie a Hens Egg: wherewith theſe Children preſently run along the Streets, and ſing certain Prayers, one anſwering the other. In the mean while the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> come out of their Houſes with Bottles or Cruiſes full of Water, which they throw into the midſt of the Cloth; by which means they believe the Woman who is in Labour is luckily deliver'd.</p>
               <p>To this idle Fancy they adde another no leſs ridiculous, to cure the Pain in the Head; by taking a Lamb or young Kid, which they hunt and beat about the Field ſo long, till it fall down, whereby they perſwade themſelves, that the pain will paſs out of the mans head into the beaſts.</p>
               <p>To countervail theſe bad and fooliſh,
<note place="margin">Two commendable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms.</note> they have ſome commendable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms:
<note place="margin">Pierre Dan. deſcript. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar.</note> One is, That how angry ſoever they are, they never ſwear by the Name of God; nor have in their Language, whether <hi>Arabick, Turkiſh,</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risk,</hi> any particular words wherewith they can curſe or blaſpheme. 'Tis true, the <hi>Renagadoes</hi> Swear deſperately in their own Tongues; but becauſe they do it in contradiction of the <hi>Turks,</hi> they are preſently moſt ſeverely puniſhed for it: The ſecond is, That how great a conteſt ſoever they have one againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, they ſeldom come to Hand-blows, but never kill.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Barbary</hi> are very ingenious,
<note place="margin">The Condition of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in Cities.</note> and ſingularly zealous in their Religion; but no people more jealous: for they had rather loſe their lives, than have a blemiſh on their Reputation; which eſpecially
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56692:102"/>they look upon, as beſt preſerved by their Wives Chaſtity. They covet Riches above meaſure, but are very modeſt in ſpeech. The Inferiours behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards their Superiours with great humility and ſubmiſſion: But Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhew wonderful Reverence and Obedience towards their Parents.</p>
               <p>The Countrey People dwell in Tents or Booths upon the Hills and Fields,
<note place="margin">The manner of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey People.</note> generally dealing in Cattel; they are not fierce of Nature, yet very couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; they live but poorly, yet are great pains-takers, and liberal.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Townſmen on the other ſide, are quarrelſome, vindicative, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable, covetous, ſetting their whole thoughts upon ſcraping together Money and Goods. They are continual Traders, but ſo ſuſpicious, that they will not truſt any Foreigner: They are great boaſters, but dull of wit, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eaſie belief to common reports, and doubtful hear-ſays, yet ſo cunning and falſe in their dealing, that they will deceive the moſt vigilant.</p>
               <p>Some of the better Sort have great inclination to Arts and Sciences,
<note place="margin">They are inclin'd to Skil and Knowledge.</note> delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly in Hiſtories, and the Expoſition of their Law. Heretofore extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily addicted to Southſaying, Magick, and Aſtrology; all which about five hundred years ſince were abſolutely forbidden by their Princes.</p>
               <p>They Ride well after their manner, and know with a ſingular dexterity to mount and diſmount: The chiefeſt Weapons of ſuch as dwell up in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, are long Launces or Javelins, in the throwing of which they are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ready: but all that coaſt upon the Sea, uſe Guns, Powder, and Shot.</p>
               <p>The whole Countrey is very healthful,
<note place="margin">The Age of the People in <hi>Barbary.</hi>
                  </note> ſo that the people by the ordinary courſe of Nature, ſeldom dye before ſixty five, or ſeventy years of Age: In the Mountains peradventure ſome be found reaching a hundred years, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laſt very ſtrong and active; but chiefly upon the Sea-Coaſts where the Air is conſtantly refreſht and agitated, by the frequency of cool Breezes, which have the ſame efficacy, working upon their Conſtitutions, ſo that they are ſeldom ſickly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barbary</hi> hath a great abundance of Merchandiſe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Barbary</hi> affords much Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe,</note> which are tranſported by Foreigners to the enriching of the Inhabitants; ſuch are untann'd or raw Hides, Linnen, and Cotton-Cloth, Raiſins, Dates, Figs, and the like; of which we will ſpeak more particularly in its proper place.</p>
               <p>Evident Signs of the great Wealth of this Kingdom in former times may be drawn hence, that the Kings of <hi>Fez,</hi> as they ſay,
<note place="margin">Signs of the Antient Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Barbary.</hi>
                  </note> formerly ſpent four hundred and eighty thouſand Crowns in the building a Colledge,
<note place="margin">Leo Africk. Peter Aviley Barbary.</note> and ſeven thouſand in erecting a Caſtle, and little leſs in founding a City, beſides his continual ſtanding Pay to his Militia. No leſs are the Riches thereof at this day,
<note place="margin">Signs of the preſent Power</note> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the great Revenue of the Kings of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez,</hi> the <hi>Baſhaws</hi> and other great Lords of <hi>Tripolis, Algiers,</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> and the infinite Trade and Merchandiſe, which the <hi>Engliſh, Venetians, Genoas, Hollanders, French, Hambur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> and other people, drive there, without taking notice of the rich Spoils the Pyrates of <hi>Barbary</hi> carry in from all parts, eſpecially <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> with too much connivance of their Governours, though ſeemingly againſt their Command.</p>
               <p>Another ſignal proof of its exceeding Wealthineſs, are the great number of <hi>Moſques,</hi> and the yearly Revenues belonging to them. For in <hi>Algiers</hi> onely there are a hundred, and in <hi>Tunis</hi> three hundred, as many alſo in <hi>Fez,</hi> and in <hi>Morocco</hi> ſeven hundred, among which the chief have two hundred Ducats An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Rent. Adde thereto, that the Plunder of <hi>Fez,</hi> when thoſe of <hi>Algiers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters of it, was valued at two hundred and ſixty Millions; and the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56692:103"/>Spoyl of <hi>Tunis,</hi> under the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, which he gave to the Soldiers for a Reward, as much, when the three chiefeſt Field-Officers gave each of them for their Heads, Thirty Millions of coyned Ducats. Moreover, the <hi>Jews,</hi> who have their chiefeſt Refuge there, as in the Center of the World, bring no ſmall advantage by the liberty of their Uſury.</p>
               <p>The Dominion of <hi>Barbary</hi> is various as the Countrey,
<note place="margin">The Government of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary.</hi>
                  </note> ſome are abſolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Kings, as thoſe of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez.</hi> Others acknowledge a Superior Lord, as the Kings of <hi>Algiers, Tunis</hi> and <hi>Tripolis,</hi> who are no other than <hi>Baſhaws</hi> or <hi>Viceroys,</hi> or under the obedience of the <hi>Great Turk,</hi> who at his Pleaſure may alter the <hi>Baſhaw:</hi> Another ſort, though Tributaries, yet Rule with abſolute Soveraignty, as the Kings of <hi>Konkue</hi> and <hi>Labez,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Xeques</hi> of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians;</hi> in the whole Countrey there is but one Common-wealth, and that too may rather be termed an Anarchy than a Republick.</p>
               <p>In every City where the <hi>Grand Signieur</hi> hath a <hi>Baſhaw</hi> Reſident,
<note place="margin">In every City is a <hi>Cady.</hi>
                  </note> a <hi>Cady</hi> is ſent to adminiſter Juſtice, who with unlimited power Judges and Determines all Civil and Criminal Cauſes. Every one there pleads his own Caſe without Proctor, Advocate, or Councel, which courſe is obſerved through all <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> except at <hi>Salle,</hi> where the <hi>Moors</hi> who are Maſters there, plead with Proctors and Advocates after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> way.</p>
               <p>The People here are,
<note place="margin">Many ſorts of People in <hi>Barbary</hi> of ſeveral Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</note> as elſewhere, of different Religions, as <hi>Mahumetans, Chriſtians, Jews,</hi> and the Countrey People, who are never congregated or make any ſhews of Devotion.</p>
               <p>In their <hi>Moſques</hi> they have no Images,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Mosques</hi> or Temples of the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi>
                  </note> but in ſtead of them, Six hundred Lamps ſometimes in a Row; about it ſtands a great Cloiſter or Hermitage, wherein the <hi>Iman</hi> or <hi>Marabou,</hi> that is, the Prieſt dwells. Their Prayers are call'd <hi>Sala,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How they pray in them.</note> and the People repeat the ſame words the Prieſt, ſays before them, and in all Geſtures imitate him, in ſeveral lifting up of their Hands and Heads to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. At their entrance into the <hi>Moſques,</hi> they put off their Shooes, kiſs the Earth, and waſh their Mouths, Noſes, Ears, the ſoals of their Feet, and Secret Parts, whereby they believe that the Pollutions of the Soul are purifi'd and clens'd. And during their abode there, they neither dare to Spit or Cough, nor ſo much as ſpeak one to another, but upon great Neceſſity; They ſit down there upon the Floor one by another, upon Matts of Date or Palm-Trees. The Women are not permitted to come thither, leſt by their ſight the Men ſhould fall into unclean Thoughts; but they commonly perform their Devotions at Home.</p>
               <p>They go to their <hi>Sala</hi> five Times a Day,
<note place="margin">They perform their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers five times a Day.</note> that is, at Day-break, which they call <hi>Caban;</hi> at Noon, call'd <hi>Dohor;</hi> in the Afternoon at four, call'd <hi>Lazar;</hi> at ſix or ſeven, which they call <hi>Magarepe,</hi> and at two in the Night, <hi>Latumar;</hi> but few reſort at all theſe Times, but the moſt Zealous, none being compell'd to it. They have neither Bells, Clocks or Dials. And when they call the People to their Devotions,
<note place="margin">How People are called to Prayers.</note> certain Officers to that purpoſe only appointed, go up to the Battlements of an high Steeple, and upon a Wooden Pole ſet up a ſmall Flag; but this is uſed no where but in <hi>Barbary.</hi> When this is done, then the <hi>Marabou</hi> turns himſelf to the South, becauſe <hi>Mecha</hi> lyeth that way; then ſtopping his Fingers in his Ears, he cryes out theſe words with a loud Voice, <hi>Lahilla Lah,</hi> Mahometh <hi>reſſoul Allah;</hi> that is, <hi>God is God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>is his Prophet.</hi> Then he turns him to other Parts, ſaying the ſame words. By this ſetting up of the Flag, and Out-cryes, the People know what hour of the Night it is. When the <hi>Marabou</hi> of the greateſt <hi>Moſque</hi> hath call'd, then all the other follow, which they act with Ridiculous and wilde Geſtures.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56692:103"/>
               <p>The <hi>Friday</hi> is their Sabbath, call'd by them <hi>Dimanche,</hi>

               <p>They uſe Coral-Beads, of an equal ſize, and in number a Hundred;

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Every Year they keep a Feaſt, which they call <hi>Ramadan,</hi> which continues a whole Moneth; during which they abſtain, from Morning to the cloſe of the Evening, from Eating and Drinking; but then the <hi>Marabou</hi> going to the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, gives them by his accuſtom'd Cryings, leave to Eat. This their Faſting, is ſo highly eſteemed, that they dare not ſo much as drink Tobacco, ſuppoſing that to be a Breach: Nay, the very <hi>Corſaires</hi> or Pyrates obſerve the <hi>Ramadan</hi> at Sea; and though the <hi>Renagadoes</hi> do not ſo ſtrictly bind themſelves to it, yet they for neglect of it, are, if known, puniſhed with an hundred or two ſtroaks on the bottoms of their Feet.</p>
               <p>After this Faſt, and long <hi>Lent</hi> ſo well kept, they celebrate their Paſſeover,

               <p>In the City of <hi>Algier,</hi> and in other Cities in <hi>Barbary,</hi> are ſeveral ſmall <hi>Moſques,</hi> where many of theſe <hi>Marabouts</hi> lye buried, whom they honor as Saints or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, or ſet before their Sepulchers burning Lamps, going thither on Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or when they are ſick, ſend Preſents to obtain Remedy.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are afflicted with the Falling-ſickneſs are held in great Eſteem,
<note place="margin">The Falling-ſickneſs in Eſteem among them.</note> becauſe <hi>Mahomet</hi> was troubled with this Diſeaſe, and ſhameleſly made them
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56692:104"/>believe, That then God by his Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> reveal'd to him the moſt ſecret Myſteries of his Religion.</p>
               <p>The higheſt Feſtival is the Nativity of their great Prophet,
<note place="margin">A Feſtival upon the Birth of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                  </note> which they celebrate with all Solemnity, the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> in manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: All the School-maſters aſſemble after Dinner with their Scholars in the chiefeſt <hi>Moſque,</hi> out of which they go in Order, every one with a Torch in his Hand, and ſing along the Streets the Eulogy and famous Acts and Praiſe of their Prophet. Two of theſe Maſters carry upon their ſhoulders a great Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide, cover'd over with Flower-Works, and a Croſs on the top of it, follow'd by vocal and inſtrumental Muſick, after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner; all the Corner-Houſes in Croſs-ways are hang'd with Tapiſtry and burning Lamps. They ſet alſo in every Houſe, about Mid-night, a lighted Torch upon the Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Mahomet</hi> was born at that Hour. During the eight Days of this Feaſt, every one may walk the Streets by Night, which at other times they dare not, on pain of corporal Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The Cooks of the <hi>Divan,</hi> to the number of Two hundred, each carrying a Napkin or Towel upon his ſhoulders, and a burning Torch in his Hand, from the ſeventh to the eleventh Hour, go two and two along the Streets, till pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing themſelves before the doors of the chiefeſt Councellors, they chant a ſolemn and appointed Hymn, in Praiſe of their Prophet, with many Inſtruments of Muſick.</p>

<note place="margin">Their Solemnity for the Dead.</note> which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in this manner: When any Dies, the next Friend hireth Women to lament, who flocking about the Corps, with ſtrange and unuſual howling make a noiſe, and ſcratch themſelves till the blood follow their Nails.

<note place="margin">How they bury their Dead.</note> the Body is incloſed in a Coffin, cover'd with a Green Cloth, upon which a Turban is ſet, as we uſe a Garland, and ſo with the Head forward, is carried to and laid in the Grave, but attended all the way thither with howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Valedictions. At the entrance of the Burial-place ſome <hi>Marabouts</hi> ſing without intermiſſion theſe words, <hi>Lahilla Lah,</hi> Mahometh <hi>reſſoul allah,</hi> that is, <hi>God is God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>is his Prophet.</hi> At laſt it is placed in the Grave in a ſitting Poſture, with a Stone under the Head, in ſtead of a Pillow, and the Face towards the South.</p>
               <p>Their Burying-places are very Large, and lye round about the Cities, for they Interr none in their <hi>Moſques,</hi> but in the plain Field, where every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Eſtate buys a ſpot of Ground, which they Wall in, and plant with Flowers. The Women every <hi>Friday</hi> viſit theſe Monuments, carrying thither Meat and Fruits, which they leave for the Poor, and for the Fowls, after they have taſted of them, believing it to be a work of Charity, and a furtherance to the bliſs of departed Souls. They pray there for their Husbands and other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friends, and comfort them ſometimes with theſe or the like words; <hi>That they ſhould have Patience in waiting for the Reſurrection of their Bodies.</hi> And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> there.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> differ in nothing from the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There are beſides theſe many other of ſeveral Nations, who taken at Sea by the Pyrates, are brought to Land and ſold for Slaves, whence they cannot be redeem'd without great Ranſoms, except by chance any make an Eſcape, which is ſeldom; or rowing in the Galleys be retaken by the Chriſtians. Theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lead a miſerable Life, undergoing the extremity of Servitude; only ſome one by good Fortune, that lights upon a milde Patron, is more gently handled.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Algier</hi> the Slavery is moſt bitter; but in the Kindoms of <hi>Tripolis, Tunis</hi> and <hi>Fez,</hi> more tollerable.</p>

Others are thruſt into the Galleys to row, where their beſt fare is Water and hard Bisket, and the reward of their Pains, drubs with a Bulls pizzle; nor is their treatment better when they come aſhore, being lockt to a heavy Chain, and at night thruſt into Dungeons, by them call'd <hi>Maſmora,</hi> where they lye upon the bare ground.</p>
               <p>Such as chance to have City Patrons,
<note place="margin">The labour of the Slaves in the Cities.</note> their chiefeſt labour is to carry Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from place to place, bear away the duſt of their Houſes, convey their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes to Ware-Houſes, work in the Mill like Horſes, knead their Dough, bake their Bread, and do all other drudgery, yet for all receive neither good word or deed, or freedom from their Fetters.</p>
               <p>Many of theſe wretched Creatures,
<note place="margin">Why many Chriſtian Slaves make deſection.</note> partly out of deſperation and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their miſery, partly out of a deſire of liberty, and hopes to attain the honour of a <hi>Janizary,</hi> renounce their Religion and turn <hi>Turks:</hi> Nay, there are many rich Women, who often give half their Goods to their Slaves, when they embrace <hi>Mahumetaniſm;</hi> and ſome even of the beſt Quality among them being Widows, are ſo zealous, that they marry their Slaves, out of deſign only to draw them to be <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> it being among the <hi>Turks</hi> accounted a moſt meritorious work to make Proſelytes to their Prophet. The ſeveral Puniſhments for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors in uſe by them are theſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that can be prov'd after Circumciſion to revolt,
<note place="margin">Their Puniſhments.</note> are ſtript quite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, then anointed with Tallow, and with a Chain about his Body, brought to the place of Execution, where they are burnt.</p>
               <p>They who are convicted of any Conſpiracy or Treaſon, have a ſharp Spit thruſt up the Fundament, others bound Hand and Foot, and caſt from a high Wall or Tower, upon an Iron Hook, whereon ſometimes they ſtick faſt by the Belly, ſometimes by the Head or other parts of the Body, ſometimes only by the Skin, and hanging many days, they ſo languiſhing in great torture, die; or elſe ty'd with a Rope about the Middle, and with four Nails faſten'd to a Croſs againſt the City Wall, they are flead alive, or bray'd to pieces in a Mortar.</p>

<note place="margin">Uſual Puniſhments.</note> and ſo ſhot all to pieces. To drag them in pieces with four Ships, to which they are ty'd, and then caſt the Quarters into the Sea, is a uſual Puniſhment; ſo it is to cut off limb by limb, or joint by joint; but to tye them up in a Sack,
<note place="margin">Light Puniſhments.</note> and draw them, is held a gentle and milde Sentence. 'Tis capital to lift up the Hand againſt a <hi>Janizary,</hi> or to commit Adultery with a <hi>Mahumetan Woman.</hi> But this later is connived at, becauſe they believe that all ſins by waſhing in the Bath, or by once plunging into the Sea, are waſhed away.</p>
               <p>Their Lodging is very mean,
<note place="margin">Their Houſhold-ſtuff.</note> being only a Mattreſs in ſtead of a Bed, which they lay upon a floor of Boards. They ſleep in their Drawers or <hi>Calſoons;</hi> they have neither Chairs, Stools or Tables, but hang their Cloaths upon Pins in the Wall. Thoſe of Quality ſit at Meals, and all other times upon pieces of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry, croſs-legg'd on the Ground; but poor People have a great Matt, made of the leaves of a Date or Palm-tree.</p>
               <p>The Men wear next their Skin a large Linnen Frock and Drawers,
<note place="margin">The Habit of the Men.</note> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that a looſe Coat of Cloth or Silk, buttoned before with great Gold or Silver Buttons, and hangs down almoſt to the knee. Their Sleeves reach but to their Elbows; ſo that turning up their Shirt upon them, their Arms are for the moſt part half way bare or naked; and inſtead of Stockins, the great men of the Court, and other People of quality, ſometime wear ſmall Turky-Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Buskins.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>They wear <hi>Turbants</hi> made of red Wooll, wound up in a piece of Cotton five or ſix Ells long.</p>
               <p>Their Slippers are piked at the Toe, of yellow or red Leather, ſhod under the Heel with Iron, having no Lappets; which they ſlip off at the door of any houſe whereto they enter, as a great point of Civility.</p>
               <p>They wear at their Girdles three very fine Knives, that is, two great, and one ſmall, in a ſilver Scabbard a foot long, adorned with Turkoyſes, and Smarag'd or Emeral'd Stones, ſo rich ſometime, that they ſtand them in above a hundred <hi>Eſcues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they make water, they ſtoop down to the ground;
<note place="margin">How they make water.</note> for it is held a ſhameleſs thing to urine ſtanding, as the Chriſtians do: And the reaſon may be, becauſe if the leaſt drop of their water fall upon them, they are polluted, and muſt forthwith waſh themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Women are Habited almoſt like the Men,

Rich Women wear commonly five or ſix Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants in each Ear, with Bracelets of Jewels on their Arms, and Silk Garments. They paint the ends of their Fingers blue, with an Herb call'd by them <hi>Gueva,</hi> perhaps our common Woad. When they go along the City in the Streets, they caſt over all a Cotton Cloak, which hangs down to their Feet, and tie a ſtring of Pearls upon their Foreheads, and a fine Kerchiff before their Eyes, ſo that they cannot be known as they go up and down the Streets. All their occaſions lie within the houſe, where they have a ſeveral apartment by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, wherein none but Women may viſit each other, the Maſter of the Houſe himſelf being at ſuch times excluded, to prevent all occaſions of jealouſie.</p>
               <p>They are curious in the beautifying themſelves according to the Faſhion of their Countrey, painting their Eye-brows and Eye-lids, and colouring their Hair black with burned <hi>Antimony.</hi>

               <p>The uſual Food of the Countrey is commonly Rice,

               <p>Their Drink at Meals is either clear Water, or <hi>Sorbet,</hi> for Wine is forbidden them by the <hi>Alcoran:</hi> And in the mornings when Tradeſmen and Merchants meet about buſineſs, they go to the Publick <hi>Coffee-Houſes,</hi> which Liquor they drink, having a great opinion of it, ſmoaking abundance of Tobacco, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much of their time there. In ſtead of Table-Cloths, they uſe red Turky-Leather Carpets, and wipe their fingers on their Handkerchiffs in ſtead of Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins: Onely at Solemn Feſtivals, the great ones wipe upon a blue Cloth fixed to the Carpet.</p>
               <p>Their Cups and Diſhes are of Tin or Earth;
<note place="margin">Their Cups or Veſſels.</note> for none may uſe Silver; onely the <hi>Sultans,</hi> they are all of Maſſy-Gold. Liquid things they eat with wooden Spoons a Foot long.</p>
               <p>Gaming is unlawful among them, ſo that they neither play at Dice, Cards, Balls, Bowls, nor any other Sport uſual with us. Sometime they will play a Game at Cheſs, but not for money.</p>
               <p>Bathes are much uſed,
<note place="margin">Great uſe of Baths.</note> beſides their frequent Waſhings enjoyned before De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; ſo that every place almoſt is filled with <hi>Bannia's.</hi>

               <p>Every City hath alſo many Free-Schools, or <hi>Meſquites,</hi> for the inſtructing of Youth to Read, Write, and caſt Accompts, but no further. The principal Book they learn, is the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which when a Scholar can read well, his School-fellows lead him in his beſt Habit along the Streets, and ſet forth his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation through the City; for beyond this none learn.</p>

                  <p>Beſides their Wives, they may keep as many Concubines as they are able to maintain, out of which the King may chooſe one to beſtow upon his Favorites. They count it no Crime to obſtuprate their Slaves, White or Black. The King hath commonly four Wives, beſides a multitude of Concubines, with whom he companies according to the dictates of his wandring Fancy.</p>

In this Market under the Ground lies the <hi>Maſmora</hi> or Common Priſon for the Slaves, receiving all its Light, with divers inconveniences, from Iron Grates lying even with the earth. This was heretofore a large place of Receipt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Ruines of the Walls and Buildings; but at preſent both in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Beauty falls ſhort of <hi>New Sale.</hi>

<note place="margin">New Sale.</note> ſtands in a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley between two high Precipices; thoſe on the Land-ſide much higher, and uneaſier to aſcend, than thoſe on the Sea-ſhore.</p>
                  <p>A double Wall guards the Land-ſide, the one old, the other new, between which they reſerve a proportion of Land, half as big as the Town, wherein they Sow yearly ſeveral Grains: The outer or new Wall defending the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance between the aforemention'd great Hills, boaſts an extraordinary Thickneſs, and the Heighth of thirty Foot, or thereabouts; but towards the Sea lies in a manner open.</p>
                  <p>Three Gates on the Land-ſide give entrance into it; one on the Eaſt,
<note place="margin">The Gates.</note> and two on the South, <hi>viz.</hi> The Gate of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and the Gate of <hi>Temſina.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Tower <hi>Aſan.</hi>
                     </note> a Four-ſquare Tower ſo call'd; adjacent to which is a Church built without a Roof, above and without are Arches about fourteen hundred Foot long, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred broad, with a ſquare Steeple of Stone two hundred Foot in Compaſs; the Aſcent to whoſe Top is ſo eaſie and broad, that ſometimes attempting, they ſcale the Top with Waggons and Horſes.</p>
                  <p>The South Point of the Steeple being towards the Church, ſtands with a gaping Rent receiv'd by a dreadful Thunderbolt.</p>
                  <p>Through the Church runs a Brook about thirty Foot deep, and a hundred broad, made in a Channel or Trough of Stone, gueſſed to be intended as a Bathing-place for the <hi>Moors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here alſo a ſtrong Caſtle, call'd <hi>Alkaſſave,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Caſtle <hi>Alkaſſave.</hi>
                     </note> ſeems proudly to ſwell into the bigneſs of a little City, encompaſſed with thick Walls, and a deep dry Trench. Formerly it incloſed two hundred Houſes, which at preſent are moſt of them faln or falling; onely one Tower remains, whoſe Top is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with <hi>Mahumetan</hi>'s <hi>Creſcents.</hi> This Caſtle was heretofore as a <hi>Seraglio</hi> for the King of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s Concubines, to the number of eight hundred, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guard of Eunuchs; but now the Reſidence and Seat of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
                  <p>Without the City lie ſeveral Sconces and Redoubts, made of Loam, and caſt up when the Caſtle was Beſieg'd, in the Year Sixteen hundred and ſixty.</p>
                  <p>Within theſe Cities are ſeveral <hi>Moſques,</hi> with incloſed Yards round about, and without divers <hi>Meſquites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Houſes, eſpecially in <hi>Old Sale,</hi> are very ſmall and ſlightly built,
<note place="margin">Their Houſes.</note> though here and there ſome are richly ſet out with Carv'd Work, and Marble Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: Generally they are but one Story high, without any Windows to the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56692:124"/>Street, or other opening than the Door; all their Light deſcends from a Loover in the midſt, about which the Chambers are placed; the whole Edifice flat-rooft, for conveniency of Walking Morning and Evening, for the benefit of the cool refreſhing Air.</p>
                  <p>The Haven is very ſpacious,
<note place="margin">The Haven.</note> but ſhallow, having at low Tyde not above a Foot, or a Foot and a half Water, though at full Sea eleven or twelve. Before the Haven lyeth a Barr, paſſable at High Water with loaden Barks and Ships, either out or in, whereas when the Tyde is out, they muſt remain at the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers mouth, and unload their Goods into ſmall Boats; out of which Landed, they carry them through the Gate <hi>Sidimuſa Ducala,</hi> upon Aſſes and Camels into the City. This ſhallowneſs of the Haven compels the <hi>Corſaires</hi> or Pyrates of this Place to uſe light Veſſels that draw little Water, which proves better for the Chace, and more advantageous in their Pyracies, and alſo in eſcaping Ships of greater Burden, whereas they of <hi>Algiers, Tunis</hi> and <hi>Tripolis,</hi> from the convenience of their Haven, put to Sea in greater Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>The Revenue conſiſts in Tributes and Cuſtoms of Exported and Imported Merchandiſe,

                  <p>The Countrey People under its Juriſdiction pay the tenth of all their Land-Fruits for a Tribute. And the Pyrates, by their Robberies againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, bring no ſmall Advantage.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Cities are now Govern'd by an <hi>Alcaide,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Government.</note> who with his choſen Councel manage all Affairs, either Martial or Civil. In the Election of a new Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Deputy, they proceed with no regularity, the Commons or <hi>Plebeians</hi> ſometimes ſetting up one from among themſelves, or if it were poſſible, below themſelves, as they did ſome few Years ſince, when without the conſent of the King or Nobles, running together upon the Governours death, without any the leaſt appearance of Reaſon, they ſet up in this mad fit an Aſs-driver, and by their own Authority impowered him; but he ſoon after his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſing the ſame ſeverity, rough handling and menaces to his new Subjects, as towards his old Slave the Aſs; they no longer pleaſed with his ſo rigorous Government, kickt him out of the Saddle, and left him to conduct by thoſe ſtern Rules his old Servant. Other great Alterations often happen in the chuſing of Governours, inſomuch that ſometimes it hath been known, that there have been three new Governours in a Moneth, ſo often turned out, either out of the Peoples hatred to them, or for their own Miſgovernment; and yet their whole Juriſdiction reaches no farther than over a few little Cities, and ſome wandring <hi>Advars,</hi> that is, <hi>Arabs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City hath from the firſt Foundation, been ſubject to Commotions and Alterations, but more eſpecially ſince the coming of the <hi>Andaluzian Moors,</hi> that were driven out of <hi>Spain,</hi> as will preſently appear.</p>
                  <p>During the continuance of the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> which was from the Year Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred and twelve, (for then they made their Conqueſts) for Six or ſeven hundred Years they kept poſſeſſion; all which time the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> made it their Maſter-piece to drive them out, eſpecially <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the Fifteenth; for he taking into ſerious Conſideration the great miſchief by them done to the Chriſtians, and the continual Wars wherewith they infeſted them, in the Year Fourteen hundred ninety two, ſet fiercely upon them, who ſeeing themſelves in a ſtraight, and even brought under the power and obedience of <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> ſeem'd to embrace Chriſtianity, though ſcarce in outward appearance they were ſuch; however, it gain'd them a breathing while, and gave them oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56692:124"/>of endeavour, at leaſt to diſtract that State; ſo that in the Year Sixteen hundred and ten, <hi>Philip</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by an Edict publiſhed the Sixteenth of <hi>January,</hi> baniſht them out of his Kingdom,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Andaluzian Moors</hi> driven out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </note> and for fear of incurring the penalties thereof, above a Million of Men, Women and Children of all Sexes, departed within the time limited, the greateſt part of whom taking Ship, paſſed into <hi>Barbary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But others ſpread themſelves into the Eaſt about <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſome came into <hi>France</hi> with the conſent of the King, who allotted them a place to dwell in; conditionally, they obſerv'd the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> wherein by perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Articles they ſo fixed themſelves, that at this Day ſome Families of them are to be found in <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Languedoc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such of them as pitched at <hi>Salee,</hi> were admitted with freedom by the King of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> believing they might be uſeful to inſtruct his People in many Trades and Handicrafts. Here a while they lived Peaceably, yielding equal Obedience with the other Subjects; but they ſoon ſtarted aſide, and with the Money, which in great quantities they brought from <hi>Spain,</hi> bought Arms and ſome Ships, wherewith they apply'd themſelves to Roving and Pyracy at Sea, pretending at firſt to take from none but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in revenge of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Baniſhment, though indeed and in truth their malice raged upon all the Chriſtians. 'Tis true, at the beginning they play'd faſt and looſe, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Trading and Merchandiſe, ſetting up <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flags and Colours in their Maſts and Sterns, and acting all in the name of <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Andaluzjans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to take from the Chriſtians.</note> as they were by Birth and Language, by which they did great Robberies; but at laſt this Trick growing ſtale, they pull'd their Vizards off, and declared themſelves openly Pyrates and Enemies to all Chriſtians. Whatſoever Prizes they took, they pay'd to the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> as a Tribute, ſeven or ten in the Hundred, as well of Priſoners as of Merchandiſe. Thus for a time they continued their Subjection to the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> but ſtill waiting an opportunity to throw off the yoak; and indeed they wanted not a ſpecious pretence, for under the colour of furniſhing their Ships, they got into their hands the beſt Arms in <hi>Salee,</hi> of which poſſeſſed and inſtigated by the natural Ambition of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey they were bred in, they brought to paſs thoſe Deſigns they had been ſo long ſecretly contriving: For firſt they made themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Alkaſſave,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">They riſe up againſt the King of <hi>Morocco.</hi>
                     </note> or Caſtle of <hi>Salee,</hi> and by that means of the City; which done, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd the <hi>Moors,</hi> baniſh'd the Natives, and expell'd all the King of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s Officers; and for their Aſſiſtance they invited to them other exiled <hi>Andaluzians,</hi> by whoſe help they took up Arms and declar'd themſelves no more to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Kings.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the King heard of this Inſurrection,
<note place="margin">The Agreement of the King of <hi>Fez.</hi>
                     </note> he immediately ſent an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thither to block up the City, which by the Charm or Magick of a Rebel <hi>Santon</hi> or <hi>Marabou,</hi> call'd <hi>Layaſſen,</hi> an inveterate Enemy to the King, ſo routed and afflicted the Royal Army, that the King was neceſſitated to break up the Siege; yet before he marched off, he made with the Rebels theſe Articles fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p n="1">That they did acknowledge Him for their Chief, and as a Token of their Submiſſion, ſhould every Year, as a Tribute, preſent ſome Slaves.</p>
                  <p n="2">That the King ſhould appoint them Officers to do Juſtice, and hear and decide Cauſes among them.</p>
                  <p n="3">That the City and the Caſtle ſhould remain in their Cuſtody.</p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:56692:125"/>
                  <p>Thus reſted Affairs for a while, but the King at laſt got poſſeſſion of the Fort, and ſettled a Garriſon in it; which the <hi>Andaluzian Moors</hi> for ſome time murmur'd at, but at length, in the Year Sixteen hundred and ſixty, they began again to take up Arms againſt thoſe of the Caſtle,
<note place="margin">New Inſurrections of the <hi>Andaluzians.</hi>
                     </note> beleagured before by about two thouſand Souldiers of <hi>Santa Crux,</hi> and other Places, under the Command of one <hi>Hamed Aginnivi,</hi> which at laſt ſo far prevail'd, that on the tenth of <hi>February</hi> the Citizens of both the Cities joined Forces with him to beleaguer and ſtraighten the Caſtle, though with little hope of ſuddenly obtaining it; whereupon in the City they caſt up ſeveral Works and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of Loam, from whence, with Muskets, for want of great Guns, they daily alarm'd thoſe of the Caſtle; the like did they of <hi>Old Salee</hi> with their great Guns. On the other ſide, the Beſieged were not wanting to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, both with great and ſmall Shot, which they plyed with ſuch effect, that they kill'd many as well in the Works as the Streets; whereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with themſelves, and finding their own ſtrength too weak for their Deſigns,
<note place="margin">They ſend a Chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to <hi>Gailand.</hi>
                     </note> they ſent to <hi>Abdulkada Gailand,</hi> Lord of <hi>Arzile, Tituan</hi> and <hi>Alkazer,</hi> a chief Officer, to crave his Aſſiſtance, whereto he preſently conſented, diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither <hi>Abdelkador Ceron,</hi> to look to <hi>New Salce;</hi> and <hi>Hadzi Fenis,</hi> with <hi>Hadzi Ibrahim Manino,</hi> to take charge of the Old City. <hi>Ceron</hi> had not long continued in his new Government, before he was treacherouſly ſurprized in his Houſe, his Neck broke, and his Body cut to pieces; whoſe Death, as it begot no ſmall terror in the hearts of the Citizens, ſo it heighten'd the hopes of thoſe in the Caſtle. Nor did this rebellious Faction contain it ſelf within the Walls, but as other infections, ſpread into the Country adjoyning; where not onely Towns, but every Family were divided into Parties, by which Contraſt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration among themſelves, minding ſolely their mad Diſputes, the Ground lay neglected, Tillage and Husbandry thrown by, whereby ſo great a Famine followed, that in the Year Sixteen hundred and ſixty, many thouſands periſht for want of ſuſtenance.</p>
                  <p>In like manner,
<note place="margin">The ſecret Conveyance of Proviſion by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to them in the Caſtle.</note> thoſe in the Caſtle were diſtreſſed for want of Proviſions, notwithſtanding ſome Citizens ſent them under-hand Supplies almoſt daily, partly out of a ſenſe of their Duty to the King, and partly out of a deſire of their own gain, though upon Diſcovery many of them were ſeverely puniſhed for it. Beſides, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were great Supporters of the loyalty of thoſe in the Caſtle, by ſending in to them Proviſion of all kinds from their Ships, which then lay in the River; as on the contrary, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> animated the Rebels.</p>
                  <p>In the end,
<note place="margin">The Agreement.</note> after the Wars had thus continued a while, <hi>Sid Tagar, Gailand</hi>'s Brother, came with about Three hundred Horſe from <hi>Arzile</hi> to <hi>Salee,</hi> to make a Peace with thoſe of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> which upon the fifteenth and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of <hi>April,</hi> in the Year Sixteen hundred ſixty four, was concluded, to the great rejoycing of the Inhabitants, upon Condition that of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions or Tenth-Moneys, which the Goods imported produced, one third Part ſhould go to the Caſtle, another to <hi>New Salee,</hi> and the laſt third Part to <hi>Old Salee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the third of <hi>May, Gailand</hi> was owned by thoſe of the Caſtle for their Lord, and as a token of their Joy, theſe Volleys of Cannon-ſhot made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation thereof; and the next day his Brother <hi>Sid Tagar</hi> drew away with his Soldiers to <hi>Arzile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the fifth of <hi>October</hi> came <hi>Gailand</hi> himſelf in Perſon, accompanied with
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56692:125"/>three or four hundred Horſe from <hi>Arzile,</hi> and pitched by the River; about eight in the Morning he was invited by the Governor <hi>Sid Hamed Aginnivy,</hi> into the Caſtle, which the next day was deliver'd up,
<note place="margin">The Caſtle delivered up to <hi>Gayland.</hi>
                     </note> beyond expectation of all that were concern'd; which done, the ſixteenth <hi>Gayland</hi> withdrew again to <hi>Arzile,</hi> having the before-mention'd <hi>Aginnivy</hi> and <hi>Sid Hamed el Xhymir</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of it for him.</p>
                  <p>The tenth of <hi>December, Sid Hamed Aginnivy</hi> took his Collegue Governor and put him in Hold, charging him to have conceal'd a hundred weight of Silver from <hi>Sid Abdala,</hi> the former Lord of the Caſtle, and fined him a thouſand <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoes</hi> or <hi>Pieces of Eight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The twenty ninth of <hi>March,</hi> in the Year Sixteen hundred ſixty five, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Gayland</hi>'s Brothers, <hi>Sid Sybi</hi> came thither, and took away with him all the principal Perſons of <hi>Salee,</hi> whom on the ſecond of the ſame month he carried to <hi>Arzile,</hi> thruſting into the City a Garriſon of Two thouſand Horſe and Foot. During the time of his ſtay, he was very friendly received by <hi>Sid Hamed;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he caſhiered the old Soldiers of <hi>Santa Crux,</hi> and other Places, who had ſo long guarded the Caſtle; and not only ſo, but took from ſome of them what they had, and Impriſon'd others. Theſe tyrannies produc'd new Commotions; for on the one and thirtieth in the Morning, the <hi>Andaluzians</hi> and their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices choſe <hi>Sid Abdulkadar Merino</hi> Commander in Chief, ſending the former Priſoner to the Caſtle. In like manner <hi>Xache Brahim Manino,</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Old Salee,</hi> they diſplaced, and put into his ſtead <hi>Xache Fenis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt of <hi>April, Sid Tybi</hi> with his own Hand, led <hi>Sid Hamed Aginnivy</hi> out at the Gate of the Caſtle, under the Cuſtody of <hi>Abulkadar,</hi> but after a little ſtay he was diſcharged and ſet at liberty, with a Reward of Two hundred Ducats: The ſame Day moſt of the Women alſo were ſent out of the Caſtle to <hi>Old Salee;</hi> but <hi>Aginnivy</hi> not contented with this, as he thought too ſlight a reward, the third day after took his Journey towards <hi>Arzile,</hi> to make his Complaint to <hi>Gayland.</hi> But the two and twentieth, tidings came to <hi>Salee,</hi> that upon <hi>Friday</hi> before their <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> he died ſuddenly, not without great ſuſpicion of Poyſon.</p>
                  <p>The two and twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Governours of the City took <hi>Merino</hi> and <hi>Xache Fenis,</hi> with one <hi>Abulkadar Roxo,</hi> to <hi>Arzile,</hi> and returned to <hi>Salee</hi> the fourth of <hi>September.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſixteenth of <hi>June,</hi> in the Year Sixteen hundred ſixty and ſix, <hi>Gailand,</hi> Lord of <hi>Alkazir,</hi> drew into the Field againſt <hi>Muly Reſis,</hi> King of <hi>Tafilet,</hi> Brother to the King of <hi>Fez;</hi> but three Days after came back again to <hi>Alkazir:</hi> About two Days after he drew into the Field again, was met by the King of <hi>Tafilet,</hi> routed and put to Flight, with the loſs of many, and revolt of more Soldiers, to the Kings ſide; <hi>Gailand</hi> himſelf wounded with a <hi>Semiter,</hi> eſcaping to <hi>Alkazir,</hi> but not daring to truſt himſelf there, within an hour fled to <hi>Arzile.</hi> The King without any oppoſition took in <hi>Alkazir,</hi> whereupon <hi>Tituan</hi> and <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Salee</hi> fell to him; ſo that now the City and Caſtle was once more reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of the King of <hi>Fez.</hi> Once before the <hi>Portugues</hi> took it, but were not able to hold it long ere it returned to the right Owner.</p>

This is not to Inſtruct, (for I know I ſpeak to one of a more clear and quick ſight than my ſelf) but I ſpeak this becauſe God hath pleaſed to grant Me a happy Victory over ſome part of thoſe Rebellious Pyrates, that ſo long have moleſted the peaceable Trade of</hi> Europe, <hi>and hath preſented further occaſion to root out the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of thoſe, who have been ſo pernitious to the good of Our Nations: I mean ſince it hath pleaſed God to be ſo cuſpicious to Our beginnings in the Conqueſt of</hi> Sale, <hi>that We might joyn and proceed in hope of like Succeſs in the War of</hi> Tunis, Algiers, <hi>and other Places (Dens and Receptacles for the inhumane Villanies of thoſe who abhor Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.) Herein whilſt We interrupt the corruption of Malignant ſpirits of the World, We ſhall glorifie the great God, and perform a Duty that will ſhine as glorious as the Sun and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56692:127"/>Moon, which all the Earth may ſee and reverence; a Work that ſhall aſcend as ſweet as the Perfume of the moſt precious Odours, in the Noſtrils of the Lord; a Work grateful and happy to Men; a Work whoſe Memory ſhall be reverenced ſo long as there ſhall be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining amongſt Men that love and honour the Piety and Vertue of Noble Minds. This Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I here willingly preſent to You, whoſe Piety and Vertues equal the Greatneſs of Your Power; that We who are Vicegerents to the Great and Mighty God, may hand in hand triumph in the Glory which the Action preſents unto us. Now becauſe the Iſlands which You Govern have been ever Famous for the unconquered Strength of their Shipping, I have ſent this my truſty Servant and Ambaſſador, to know whether in Your Princely Wiſdom You ſhall think fit to aſsiſt Me with ſuch Forces by Sea as ſhall be anſwerable to thoſe I provide by Land, which if You pleaſe to grant, I doubt not but</hi> The Lord of Hoſts <hi>will protect and aſsiſt thoſe that Fight in ſo glorious a Cauſe. Nor ought You to think this ſtrange, that I, who ſo much reverence the Peace and Accord of Nations, ſhould exhort to a War. Your Great Prophet</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>was the Lion of the Tribe of</hi> JUDAH, <hi>as well as the</hi> Lord <hi>and</hi> Giver of Peace, <hi>which may ſignifie unto You, That he which is a Lover and Maintainer of Peace, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appear with the Terror of his Sword, and wading through Seas of Blood, muſt arrive to Tranquility. This made</hi> JAMES <hi>Your Father of glorious Memory, ſo happily Renowned among all Nations: It was the Noble Fame of Your Princely Vertues, which reſounds to the utmoſt corners of the Earth, that perſwaded me to invite You to partake of that Bleſsing wherein I boaſt my ſelf moſt Happy. I wiſh God may heap the Riches of his Bleſsings on You, increaſe Your Happineſs with Your Days, and hereafter perpetuate the Greatneſs of Your Name in all Ages.</hi>

                  <p>Round about the <hi>Moſques</hi> are a hundred and fifty Common-Houſes of Eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, built Four-ſquare, and divided into Single-Stool-Rooms, each furiſhed with a Cock and a Marble Ciſtern, which ſcowreth and keeps all neat and clean, as if theſe Places were intended for ſome ſweeter Employment.</p>

                  <p>There are eighty ſix publick Springs or Wells, which afford the Citizens abundance of Water, beſides ſix hundred other in Palaces, Hoſpitals, and great Buildings.</p>
                  <p>The Houſes are artificially built of Bricks,

                  <p>The Cielings and Beams of the Rooms are commonly Gilt, Carv'd, and Painted with delightful Colours; the Roofs are flat, and artificially laid with Pavements, which in Summer are cool Repoſes.</p>
                  <p>Here their Houſes are two or three Stories high with Galleries; the middle of the Houſe lying always open, with Rooms on each ſide, having high and broad Doors, furniſh'd to the whole Length with a great Preſs or Cheſt of Drawers, in which they lay up their Habits, or what ever elſe they have a great eſteem for.</p>

                  <p>Many Houſes have Stone Ciſterns, ten or twelve Cubits long, ſix or ſeven broad, and ſix or ſeven Foot deep, handſomely painted and varniſhed over, under which ſtands a Marble Trough, receiving the redundant Water of the Ciſtern. They are kept pure and clean, though never kept cover'd, but in Summer when Men, Women, and Children bathe in it.</p>
                  <p>The Houſes have alſo commonly peculiar Turrets, ſomething elevated from the reſt, in which when they go abroad they ſecure their Wives; who to paſs the time with more content, from thence have a full Survey of the whole City.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſeven hundred <hi>Moſques</hi> there,
<note place="margin">The Churches.</note> above half a hundred are very ſpacious, and of great Reception, and ſtately built on Marble Pillars, mingled with Stone Fountains on the Tops.

There are in that Church above nine hundred Arches with Marble Pillars, at each of which hangs a lighted Lamp.</p>
                  <p>About a Mile from hence lieth <hi>New-Fez,</hi> a glorious Structure,

                  <p>He divided it into three parts; the firſt allotted to be the Kings Palace,
<note place="margin">It was divided into three Parts.</note> and a Reſidence for the Children and Brothers of the King; wherein were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained many Gardens, ſtately <hi>Moſques,</hi> and Chambers for Accounts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of the Revenue: Round about were Manſions for Artificers; in the midſt Dwellings for Receivers, Treaſurers, Labourers, Notaries, Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptants, and Secretaries. Near the Treaſury-Chamber was the Goldſmiths Row, and other Conveniences for the Aſſay-Maſter, and Maſter of the Mint.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Part he ſet out for a Palace for his Courtiers, Officers, and chief Men, contain'd within a Line of Fifteen hundred Paces, from Eaſt to Weſt, and adjoyning to a Market, ſet round about with Shops of Merchants and Artificers. The third Part was at firſt the Quarters of the Kings Life-Guard, but now is for the moſt part Inhabited by <hi>Jews</hi> and Goldſmiths.</p>
                  <p>This New City hath no fewer <hi>Moſques,</hi> Baths, and Colledges, than the Old.

                  <p>This City was brought to full Perfection in an Hundred and forty Years, being environ'd with ſtrong Walls, and accommodated with Conveniences and Ornaments fit for a City, except the fore-mentioned Water-Work, which it had not of divers Years after, being only contented with Water brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a Spring, ten Miles diſtant through Pipes, by the contrivance of a <hi>Genoeſe.</hi>

                  <p>Beſides this Fertility of the Land, the Rivers are wonderouſly ſtor'd with Fiſh of divers kinds, eſpecially that by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call'd <hi>Sabalos.</hi>

                  <p>The Land about <hi>Salee</hi> produceth multitudes of Box-Trees, and other Wood, whereof the Inhabitants make Combs. Much Cotton alſo, but little Grain, by reaſon of the Sandineſs of the Soyl.</p>

                  <p>The Woods breed the ſtrongeſt and fierceſt Lions in all <hi>Africa,</hi> to the great annoyance of the People: Nor do they want good Honey and Sugar-Canes, in the uſe whereof they were ignorant, till the <hi>Moors</hi> baniſht out of <hi>Spain</hi> taught them how to extract it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> Countrey produceth many excellent Fruits, eſpecially great Quinces, Granates, White and Damask Plumbs, large Figs, Grapes, which they eat freſh gather'd, Peaches, and abundance of Olives and Flax.</p>

At Supper, nothing but Bread with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, or Raiſins, or Milk; but in the Winter, boyl'd Fleſh with <hi>Couſcous,</hi> but ſeldom Roaſt-meat. This is the ordinary Fare of common Citizens; but Perſons of State or Quality have many additional Delicacies. The Tables are low, without Table-Clothes or Knives, pulling their Meat in pieces with their Fingers. They put Fleſh and Pottage in the ſame Diſh, out of which every one may take what he pleaſes. They never drink till they have done eating, and then conclude their Meal with it.</p>

                     <hi>Mazagran</hi> hath a Haven, the ſame as <hi>Marmol</hi> thinks which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> named the Haven of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and is environed with high Walls, and both ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beautified with a great Caſtle.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Mazagrans</hi> are untoward,

                  <p>A Mile Weſtward of <hi>Horan,</hi> by the ſide of a little Bay, ſtands <hi>Marzalquibir,</hi> thought to be the place which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calleth <hi>The Great Haven,</hi> and placed in <hi>Mauritania Caeſarienſis;</hi> nor is the Opinion without great ſhew of Reaſon, for that <hi>Marzalquibir,</hi>

                  <p>This with all its advantages, in the Year Fifteen hundred and five, was by the Marqueſs <hi>de Comarez,</hi> taken from the <hi>Moors,</hi> and annexed to <hi>Spain,</hi> under which it long hath, and ſtill doth continue.</p>

                     <p>Hiſtory records to this purpoſe; That after the Death of this King, his Son having been taken and led in Triumph to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> did teſtifie ſo great a moderation in the diſaſter of his Captivity, that he won the hearts of the <hi>Romans</hi> by the high Fame of his Worth and incomparable Vertues; which was the cauſe why <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Julius,</hi> reſtor'd to that young Prince the Liberty which he had loſt, and gave him the Dominions of his Father: So that by way of acknowledgement of ſo great a Favor from <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> having wholly new built this which was then call'd <hi>Jol,</hi> he order'd to be added to it the Word <hi>Caeſaria;</hi> upon which it hath ever ſince been call'd <hi>Jol,</hi> or <hi>Julia Caeſaria,</hi> as may be ſeen by certain Medals of <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that <hi>Algier</hi> is the ſame City which the Antients call'd <hi>Jol,</hi> appeareth manifeſtly; inaſmuch as the Deſcriptions which the old Geographers made thereof, are not to be veriſi'd in any other City of <hi>Barbary,</hi> ſave this alone. Others have been pleas'd to affirm alſo, that it was at firſt call'd <hi>Meſgrana.</hi> But this ſeems to me altogether improbable, in regard that neither <hi>Strabo</hi> nor
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56692:151"/>
                        <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> nor the other Authors who have been curious in Geographical Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, do not ſpeak any thing thereof, nor of any ſuch People. However, of all the Names that it may have had heretofore, that of <hi>Algier</hi> is onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at this day; which happen'd in this faſhion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sarazens</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> coming to act their Robberies in <hi>Africa,</hi> landed there in ſundry places, like ſo many impetuous Torrents, and there committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable outrages.

They call'd it therefore <hi>Algezair,</hi> which in the <hi>Arabick</hi> ſignifieth <hi>An Iſland,</hi> becauſe it is ſcituated near unto a ſmall Iſland, where the Mole of its Port is at this day, the Sea waſhing its Walls on the North-ſide. And this Name hath ever ſince continu'd; but yet it hath been ſeveral ways corrupted; ſome calling it <hi>Algier,</hi> and others <hi>Argier,</hi> or <hi>Argel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>¶ ALthough its Soil be for the moſt part Mountainous,
<note place="margin">The Nature of the Soil.</note> yet is it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding good and fertile, as well in its Valleys, as all along the Sea-Coaſts. You there may ſee very fine Gardens, and Vineyards alſo which the <hi>Moorisks</hi> have there Planted: Inſomuch, that for eight or ten Leagues round, there are counted above eighteen thouſand Gardens, which are as it were ſo many Farms, which are call'd in <hi>Lingua Franca, Maceries,</hi> in which are kept great numbers of Slaves to Cultivate the Land, and keep their Cattel.</p>
                     <p>This Town,
<note place="margin">The Houſes.</note> which hath all its Houſes whited with Chalk or Plaiſter within and without, maketh a very fine ſhew to ſuch as approach unto it by Sea: For it preſents it ſelf unto the view inſenſible, as it were by certain ſteps, and groweth higher and higher, in manner of an <hi>Amphitheater;</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is, becauſe it being upon the ſide of a little Hill, expoſeth all its Houſes to the open view with Terraſs Roofs; from the top of which they have the pleaſure to behold the Sea, one Houſe not hindering the Proſpect of another. Now although it be of a ſquare Figure, yet it ſeemeth much leſs above than below; which happeneth according to the Rules of Perſpective, by reaſon of the defect of the Sight, which determines in the Pyramidal Form.</p>
                     <p>Its Streets are for the moſt part ſo narrow,
<note place="margin">The Streets.</note> that two men can ſcarce go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſt in them; yet we muſt except thoſe that are adjacent to the Gates of the City. They make them thus narrow, that they may be the more cool, for that the heat is there very violent. The Houſes are but of one Story, all built of Brick and Clay, but plaiſter'd and waſhed over with Chalk; having on the outſide neither beauty, nor order of Architecture, yet they are for all that very handſome within. They are moſt commonly pav'd with little Bricks of ſundry colour'd Clay, laid in faſhion of <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work. There are four Galleries above and below, with a Court in the midſt. The Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are broader than they are long, and let in Light onely at the Doors, which are very large, and all of the full Heighth of the Room from Floor to Cieling. 'Tis true, thoſe that are adjoyning to the Street, have ſome kind of Windows. They have very few of them any Gardens, and are all very cloſe, that being the Form of Building in all the Cities of <hi>Barbary</hi> Pyrates.</p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:56692:151"/>
                     <p>The moſt goodly Houſe in <hi>Algier,</hi> is that of the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> or Vice-Roy,
<note place="margin">Publick Building.</note> which is almoſt in the midſt of the City, and onely remarkable for two ſmall Galleries, one over the other, ſupported by a double Row of Columns of Marble and Porphyry, with ſome Enrichments of <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work. There are likewiſe two Courts, the one more ſpacious than the other, encompaſſed with Galleries, where the <hi>Divan</hi> ſits every Saturday, (at the entrance of the <hi>Alcaſſaw</hi>) Sunday, Munday, and Tueſday.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo nine other Houſes of note, which they call <hi>Caſſeria's,</hi> or <hi>Funduca's.</hi> The <hi>Janizaries,</hi> to whom they ſerve as Lodgings, have one Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber betwixt every eight of them: And though they be many in number, yet they are ſo cleanly, that in all their Apartments one ſhall not ſee any thing that is offenſive. Indeed it is true, that there be ſeveral Slaves of the <hi>Divan</hi> appointed to take care to keep them cleanly; beſides the <hi>Turks</hi> have this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them, of being very neat in their Houſes. Beſides thoſe above-nam'd, there be ſix others of conſiderable bigneſs, which they call <hi>Bagna</hi>'s, which are the Priſons in which they keep up the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves. He that would make a near compute of all the Houſes of <hi>Algier,</hi> ſhall finde at leaſt Fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, which are, as I ſaid before, all very cloſe, and ſometimes contain in one of them five or ſix Families.</p>
                     <p>Many have affirmed,
<note place="margin">Number of Houſes and Inhabitants.</note> that this City containeth an hundred thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, accounting Natural <hi>Turks, Moors, Janizaries, Slaves,</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> Of theſe laſt there may be about nine or ten thouſand, to whom it is permitted to have their Synagogues, and a free Exerciſe of their Religion. And yet for all that, they are no better uſed there, than in all the Parts of Chriſtendom: For beſides the Impoſts charged upon them, it's permitted to every one, yea and to the Chriſtians themſelves, to offer them a thouſand Affronts. They are diſtinguiſh'd from other men by a Bonnet which they are oblig'd to wear, and which ought to be black, as alſo all the reſt of their Clothes.</p>
                     <p>The Circuit of the City is about, by the Walls,
<note place="margin">The Compaſt.</note> three thouſand four hundred Paces; in which Incloſure there are ſundry <hi>Moſques,</hi> in which they make their <hi>Sala:</hi> the principal of which is that which ſtands along by <hi>Yeſſall,</hi> near to the Sea, which they call <hi>The Great Moſque,</hi> although it have not in it any thing remarkable more than the reſt.</p>
                     <p>As to Inns, they have none amongſt them;
<note place="margin">No Inns.</note> ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Moors</hi> which come thither, muſt of neceſſity lodge with ſome one of their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But if there come thither any Free Chriſtians, or Merchants, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take Lodgings in the Houſes of <hi>Turks;</hi> but in thoſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> they may, who have their Quarters aſſign'd them apart in the City; and amongſt whom there be always ſome which keep Chambers to that purpoſe, unleſs that ſuch Merchants, to be the more private, do chuſe rather to take an Houſe in the City; which is permitted them to do, in what Quarter they like beſt.</p>
                     <p>But in ſtead of theſe Inns,
<note place="margin">But Taverns, and by whom they are kept.</note> there are a great number of Taverns and Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling Houſes, which are not lawful to be kept by any ſave Chriſtian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives. In theſe are ordinarily ſold Bread, Wine, and Victuals of all kinds. Thither flock the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Renegates</hi> of all ſorts, there to make their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches. And although the uſe of Wine be very ſtrictly forbidden them by their Law, yet they do not in the leaſt ſcruple to violate it; and there do very few Evenings paſs, in which you ſhall not ſee ſome one or more of them drunk; who carry themſelves to ſuch Chriſtians as they meet in that humor, with inſolence, and often ſtrike, and moſt commonly wound them.</p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:56692:152"/>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>There are uſually ſix Gates open, and others ſhut.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is that of <hi>Babaſon,</hi> which is towards the Eaſt: In its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, which is very ſmall, are wont to lodge the Merchant-<hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Arabs,</hi> which bring Proviſions to the City. It was on this ſide that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth batter'd and beſieg'd it. There they put the <hi>Turks</hi> to death; and you at all times ſee one or other that is there empal'd, or gauched, as they call it, and ſet upon the Walls, as we ſhall ſhew more at large by and by.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, which they call <hi>Porto-novo,</hi> is of the ſame ſide, by which one paſſeth to <hi>Caſtello del Imperador.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third is the Gate of the <hi>Alcaſſaw,</hi> ſo call'd, for that it is near unto that Palace, which is as it were the <hi>Arcenal</hi> and Magazine, wherein they keep all their Ammunition of War.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is that call'd <hi>Babalowetta,</hi> which looks towards the Weſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Gate there is a place which theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> have appointed for the putting of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to death; many of which have, and ſtill do there receive the Crown of Martyrdom, chuſing rather to ſuffer all imaginable Torments, than to renounce the Profeſſion of the true God, to embrace the Impieties of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And this is the onely place of the City where they are put to death. Without this Gate is the <hi>Turks</hi> Cemetery, or Burying-place, which is about a League in Compaſs; at the end of which, inclining towards the Sea, is that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and faſt by, that of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which the Sea doth often waſh with its Waves.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is the <hi>Porta della Mole,</hi> ſo call'd, for that it looks directly upon it. This Mole is a great Maſs of Stones in the Form of an Half-Moon; the Breadth is about ſix or ſeven Paces, and its Length above three hundred. This egregious Structure giveth ſhape to the Port, where there are uſually above an hundred Veſſels for Piracy, and others. It is ſo unſecure in <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> by reaſon of an Eaſt and by North Winde, that in the Year One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred and nineteen, there were twenty five Veſſels rackt in one
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56692:152"/>day. This is alſo call'd the <hi>Porta della Dogana,</hi> becauſe that there the Cuſtoms are wont to be paid.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth and laſt Gate is towards the Sea-ſide, directly oppoſite to the <hi>Arſenal</hi> of the Shipping, and is call'd in <hi>la Lingua Franca, La Porta della Piſcade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> Where it is to be noted, that in ſome of theſe Gates there be always three or four <hi>Turks</hi> for a Guard, with great ſtaffs in their hands, which they do not ſeldom lay upon the ſhoulders of the poor Slaves, when they paſs that way, which they moſt commonly do in ſport, but out of a malicious fancy.</p>
                     <p>There are reckon'd at this day above an hundred Fountains in the City of <hi>Algier,</hi> that have been erected within this twenty five years onely; whereas before they had none but Ciſterns. A <hi>Moriſco</hi> nam'd <hi>Padron Mouſſa,</hi> of the Race of thoſe who were expell'd <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Year One thouſand ſix hundred and ten, and One thouſand ſix hundred and eleven, did make them by means of an <hi>Aquaeduct,</hi> which was brought two Leagues from without the City. 'Tis eaſie to believe, that this Work coſt much Sweat and Toil to the poor <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves, that wrought in the ſame without intermiſſion during the moſt violent Heats, as they daily do now in making the Mole of the Port.</p>
                     <p>The Walls of the City are reaſonable good, part of Brick,
<note place="margin">The Walls.</note> and part of Stone, with ſquare Towers, and certain Baſtions, of which the beſt are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Babaſon Gate,</hi> where there be deep Trenches; and towards the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the Wall ſtands upon a Rock, againſt which the Waves beat.</p>
                     <p>I come next to the Fortreſſes of the City, which are a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, all built regularly according to the Art of Modern Fortifications.</p>
                     <p>¶ THe firſt is on the Eaſt-ſide, flanked at the top of a Mountain,
<note place="margin">The Fortreſſes.</note> from whence one may greatly incommode the Town, and batter it to pieces. It's call'd <hi>Caſtello del' Imperador,</hi> for that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, having laid Siege to <hi>Algier</hi> in the Year One thouſand five hundred forty and one, of which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter, did there begin that Fort, which the Inhabitants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards finiſhed. In the ſtate wherein it is at this day, it ſerves the Town for a <hi>Cittadel,</hi> in which there is commonly a Garriſon of an Hundred Men, with ſundry Pieces of Cannon.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is call'd <hi>Caſtel-novo,</hi> or <hi>The Seven-corner'd Caſtle;</hi> for that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſix Angles. This Fortreſs is betwixt the Town and <hi>Caſtel del' Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> towards the South, about five hundred Paces diſtant from the City.</p>
                     <p>The third is the <hi>Alcaſſaw,</hi> which is of a very great Extent within the City, and makes a part of the Wall betwixt the Eaſt and South.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is on the Weſt, three hundred Paces without <hi>Porta Babalowetta,</hi> flanked upon the point of a little Rock towards the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is a good Bulwark, but ſmall, cloſe by the <hi>Porta della Mole,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Great <hi>Caſſaria.</hi> In it are obſervable five great Field-Pieces, which on the ſide towards the Sea defend the Port; but above all, there is in this Fort a very fine Canon of ſeven Cylinders or Bores, which ſerveth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Entry of the Gate.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth is a little Iſland upon Piles in the midſt of the Mole.
<note place="margin">The Haven and Mold.</note> It is a <hi>Pentagon,</hi> or a Figure of Five Angles, in form of a Tower, in the top of which are five great Guns for the Defence of the ſaid Mole.</p>

                     <figure/>
                     <p>The ſeventh is a little Tower at the entrance of the ſaid Port, towards the Mouth of the Mole, wherein a Guard is kept, and in which for the uſe of the Navigators, a great Lanthorn is ſometimes plac'd a nights. It is kept by eight <hi>Moors,</hi> who ſtand Centinel along the Mole, and by a dozen more that lye at the Entry thereof in a Boat.</p>
                     <p>There are planted upon this Mole Sixty ſix Pieces of Cannon, ſmall and great; and are kept there onely for a remembrance of the Victory which they of <hi>Algier</hi> obtain'd over thoſe of <hi>Tunis,</hi> when in the Year One thouſand ſix hundred twenty ſeven, they defeated their <hi>Armado,</hi> at which they became Maſters of theſe Guns. Amongſt them all, there be four ſmall ones very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, two of which belong'd to <hi>Simon Dancer,</hi> a notorious <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Pyrate.</p>
                     <p>¶ NOw although that this City have all the Fortreſſes which we have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<note place="margin">The Guards.</note> yet it is for all that to be commanded on all ſides, except on that towards the Sea; for that there be ſundry Hills and Mountains from whence it may be beaten to duſt. The Garriſons which are put into them, are onely deſign'd for the Guard of the City. Beſides this, the <hi>Meſwar,</hi> or Executioner follow'd by ſundry Aſſiſtants, doth conſtantly each night walk the Round, and the Patroul thorow all the many Streets: And as for the leſſer, they are for the moſt part ſhut up ſo ſoon as night begins to approach. And if the <hi>Meſwar</hi> meeteth any one whoſe excuſe ſeemeth not to him ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, he preſently ſeizeth on him, and carrieth him to Priſon. The next day he giveth an account thereof to the <hi>Divan,</hi> or to the <hi>Cadie:</hi> And if the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner be ſo unfortunate that he cannot appeaſe the Judge with reaſons, or take off the <hi>Meſwar</hi> with Money, this accident will coſt him ſometimes two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Blows of a Cudgel; which there is no way to avoid but by emptying of his Purſe: for the truth is, that there, as well as in other places, Gold and Silver are powerful Charms.</p>

                     <p>¶ IN <hi>Algier, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Sally,</hi> and the other Pyratick Towns of <hi>Barbary,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Language.</note> three different kinds of Languages are ſpoken. The firſt is the <hi>Arabick,</hi> or <hi>Morisk,</hi> which is that of the Countrey. The ſecond is the <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of reſemblance with thoſe of the <hi>Arabs</hi> or <hi>Moors.</hi> And the third is that they call <hi>La Franca,</hi> which is commonly uſed to make ones ſelf underſtood; which is a kind of eaſie and pleaſant <hi>Jargon,</hi> compounded of <hi>French, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Each Nation that keepeth an Ambaſſadour at the Port of the <hi>Grand Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnior,</hi> hath a Conſul at this City, by whom the Differences are determined that may ariſe betwixt the People of his Nation. He likewiſe keeps his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor with the Kings Seal; and in this Chancery are thoſe Acts and Buſineſſes ratifi'd which thoſe of that Nation do Tranſact among themſelves. Which is done for Paying Three <hi>per Cent.</hi> which the Conſul hath power to take upon all the Merchandiſes of the People of his Nation that come thither to Trade. But then he is to ſecure them at his own Charges, from all the Frauds and Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> may chance to offer them. And the ſame is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in all the other Pyratick Towns.</p>
                     <p>¶ WE ſhall now in order proceed to their <hi>Militia.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Militia.</note> And though at this day the <hi>Janizaries</hi> have the whole Command in <hi>Algier,</hi> yet that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Government hath not been always ſuch: for at the time of <hi>Ariadin, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa</hi> made himſelf Maſter of the City, and that his Brother <hi>Cheridine</hi> ſucceeded him, they both Commanded abſolutely: but that form of Rule did change amongſt the People of <hi>Algier</hi> after that the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> began to ſend them <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> or Governours: whence it happens ſometimes, that this <hi>Militia</hi> flying into Revolts, have ſet up ſome, and driven out others; to which the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> hath not thought fit to give a check, for fear of exaſperating them, and wholly diverting them from his Obedience. And this is the reaſon why he, being well acquainted with the Diſpoſition of that People, and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that they may procure unto himſelf, if he ſhould uſe any Violence againſt them, contents himſelf to ſend thither in his Name a <hi>Baſhaw</hi> that repreſents his Perſon, and who onely takes care that nothing be tranſacted to the diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Highneſs.</p>
                     <p>Whereby you may ſee that this <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> or <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> hath all the Honours of State, reſerving the Government. And thus the <hi>Militia</hi> hath inſenſibly uſurped the Soveraign Authority in <hi>Algier:</hi> for how conſiderable ſoever the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> is, he can conclude upon nothing without the advice of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that <hi>Militia,</hi> nor ſo much as go to the <hi>Divan</hi> unleſs he be ſent for.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole one may affirm,
<note place="margin">This is that goodly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Government which our <hi>Engliſh Janizaries,</hi> or <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> introduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us in the Winter of <hi>Anno</hi> 1659.</note> that this is at this day a State that Apes a Soveraign, whereas the other <hi>Baſhaws</hi> and <hi>Beglerbegs,</hi> which Command in the Provinces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire (excepting, beſides this, thoſe alſo of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Tripoly</hi> of <hi>Barbary,</hi> Pyratical Cities) are abſolute over the <hi>Janizaries.</hi> But ever ſince that the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Algier</hi> is put in poſſeſſion of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority, nothing doth paſs without the expreſs Order of it, which in the Declarations and Edicts it ſends forth, doth always ſpeak in theſe Terms of high Preheminence:
<q>
                           <hi>WE the Great and Small, the Puiſſant and Invincible</hi> Militia <hi>of</hi> Algier, <hi>and of its whole Realm, have Determined and Reſolved.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the better to underſtand what concerns this <hi>Militia,</hi> I do think fit to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56692:154"/>ſpeak of it firſt in particular, untill we come to ſpeak of its <hi>Divan</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p>When I conſider this <hi>Militia,</hi> I fancy it to be like unto a Baſilisk, which Nature hath crowned for the King of Serpents, but whoſe Looks are conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and mortal. Even ſo doth this Monſter carry Death in its Eyes, ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is it to all thoſe whom it intends to hurt; and it is onely its violence that hath put the Crown upon its Head.</p>
                     <p>It conſiſts of Twenty two thouſand Men; of which ſome are Natural <hi>Turks</hi> of the <hi>Levant,</hi> and Sons of <hi>Turks,</hi> which they call <hi>Couloys,</hi> and the reſt Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, or Strangers, or Natives of the Place. There is a neceſſity of having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome Natural <hi>Turks,</hi> to the end the Advantage may be equal betwixt them and the Renegadoes, without either getting the Maſtery of the other. Nevertheleſs the Renegadoes cannot be Souldiers, or receive Pay in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> unleſs they be free and franck: that is, unleſs they have found out ſome means to Redeem themſelves, or their Maſters have conferred on them the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Freedom: which they ſometimes do, when they have been well Served, or when they become Renegadoes at their ſolicitation: for although a Chriſtian Captive do take the <hi>Turban,</hi> and turn <hi>Turk,</hi> yet do they not ceaſe to be Slaves, unleſs he be freed by one of thoſe ways.</p>
                     <p>But if it chance that there remain but few Natural <hi>Turks</hi> in this <hi>Militia,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that they are dead, or for that they are return'd into their Native Countrey, in ſuch Caſe the new <hi>Baſhaws</hi> which come from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> bring others along with them, or ſend for them into the <hi>Levant:</hi> inſomuch, that in ſuch Caſe they take the firſt that come; and very often the poor Shepherds, or ſuch like, which they train up to handle Arms.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> can have no Office in this <hi>Militia,</hi> thereby to prevent the ſuſpicion that might ariſe, leſt that being Natives of the Place, they ſhould conſpire under-hand together, to expell thence the <hi>Turks</hi> and Renegadoes, and aſſume the Soveraign Authority into their own hands. Nor are the <hi>Morisks,</hi> who were driven out of <hi>Spain,</hi> admitted to that Priviledge. And if there be occaſion to Enroll a Man, which is moſt commonly done onely in <hi>Algier,</hi> it is the Cuſtom to go and find out the <hi>Aga,</hi> who is the Chief of the <hi>Militia,</hi> or the Colonel, or the General, as alſo the Clerk to the <hi>Divan,</hi> who do take the Names of thoſe that are liſted, and inſtantly put them into Pay, which is Four <hi>Doubles</hi> a Moneth,
<note place="margin">Their Pay.</note> each <hi>Double</hi> being worth Ten <hi>Sols</hi> of <hi>French</hi> Money. They have moreover each day Four Ammunition-Loaves: but if they be Married, as they may be, they have no Bread, but may dwell in the City with their Family.</p>
                     <p>This Pay is encreaſed a <hi>Double</hi> by the Moneth, as often as thoſe who receive it are found to be in the Field gathering the <hi>Liſmes</hi> or Tributes of the <hi>Moors,</hi> or that a new <hi>Baſhaw</hi> doth come; and as often likewiſe as any Male-Child is born unto the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi> And thus the ſaid Pay mounteth, until it come to Forty <hi>Doubles</hi> the Moneth; but can never riſe higher, according to the preſent Eſtabliſhment, for any Officer whatever. And this was Enacted ſome years ſince, by reaſon there was not found Money enough to pay the whole <hi>Militia.</hi> From this <hi>Militia</hi> are drawn forth all the Souldiers of the Garriſons which are diſperſed in the Frontier Towns of the Kingdom, which are changed every Six Moneths, and are called the <hi>Pubes;</hi> of which the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades are compoſed, as hath been ſaid above.</p>
                     <p>Now when the queſtion is made about Arming a Pyrate-Ship, amongſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56692:154"/>the other Souldiers, there are conſtantly ſome of this <hi>Militia,</hi> of which Three or four thouſand remain in <hi>Algier</hi> for a Guard to the City, and to ſerve upon the occaſions that may ariſe. As for their Quarter, it is ordinarily in Nine great Houſes, which they call <hi>Caſſeria's,</hi> where, or elſewhere they may follow any Trade that they are skill'd in. In which doubtleſs, that which doth much encourage them is, that the leaſt among them may attain when time ſhall ſerve, according to his order of reception, to be the chief Commander of this <hi>Militia;</hi> for they ſucceſſively riſe from Degree to Degree, and from Office to Office, until they come to the Quality of <hi>Aga:</hi> nor can any Favour, or other Conſideration change this method. And becauſe it is impoſſible to underſtand this, but by knowing the Degrees and Names of thoſe Officers, it is requiſite that I here inſert them, beginning at the loweſt, and aſcending to the higheſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">From ſimple Souldiers and <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who are called <hi>Oldachy's,</hi> after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, as their turn comes, they are made <hi>Biquelars,</hi> otherwiſe Cooks to the <hi>Divan,</hi> which is the firſt ſtep to riſe unto the great Offices following. Theſe <hi>Biquelars</hi> are thoſe that in the <hi>Caſſeria's,</hi> Garriſons, Camps or Armies, are to take care about providing Meat and Drink for the Officers, and principal Commanders of this <hi>Militia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">From <hi>Biquelars</hi> and Caterers they come to be <hi>Odabachy's,</hi> that is Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of Companies, or Commanders of Squadrons, of which the number of Souldiers is not limited; for they conſiſt ſometimes of Ten, and ſometimes of Twenty. Theſe have Six <hi>Doubles</hi> a Moneth for Pay, and expectation of having it augmented to them, as we have ſaid already; and they wear for a mark of Honour a great Trayle of half a Foot broad, which hangeth down their Backs above a Foot in length, with two long <hi>Oſtrich</hi> Feathers.</p>
                     <p n="3">From the Charge of <hi>Odabachy's</hi> they riſe to that of <hi>Boulouchbachy's,</hi> or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains, which one may know by a piece of Copper Gilt, which they wear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Turban,</hi> in faſhion of a Pyramid, and a very high Plume.</p>
                     <p n="4">From <hi>Boulouchbachy's,</hi> or Captains, they come to be <hi>Ajabachy's,</hi> which are but Twenty four, and are the chief of the <hi>Divan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">From the quality of <hi>Ajabachy's,</hi> they aſcend to that of <hi>Aga,</hi> Commander, or Colonel-General of all the <hi>Militia.</hi> They can continue but two Moneths at the moſt in this Charge, and ſometimes they change five or ſix of them in a day, when they are not judged capable thereof by the <hi>Divan:</hi> inſomuch that ſometimes there have been Three in a quarter of an hour. But let them be never ſo unfit for it, yet nevertheleſs the have all the honour to have preſided in the <hi>Divan,</hi> although that ſometimes they have not been Seated in the Chair of the <hi>Aga,</hi> nor declared ſuch: and in that caſe the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> is obliged to give each of them a Scarlet Veſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">After they have paſt the Dignity of <hi>Aga,</hi> they hold the Quality of <hi>Manſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laga's,</hi> that is to ſay, they are ſuch as our <hi>Veterans,</hi> called by the <hi>Romans, Emeriti Milites;</hi> for they are after that no longer obliged to the Function of Souldiers, and yet never ceaſe as long as they live, to receive Pay, which is about Forty <hi>Doubles,</hi> which amounts to Twenty <hi>Livres</hi> of <hi>French</hi> Money. But if the <hi>Divan</hi> are to chuſe a Generall for the Fields, or for the Fleets, they commonly take him from amongſt theſe <hi>Manſulaga's,</hi> for that they are Men of Experience, and well skilled in matters of War.</p>
                     <p>Now all that are of the <hi>Militia</hi> are ſo much eſteemed amongſt them, that they do not make any account of a Man unleſs he be a Souldier; although that very often the principal of thoſe Officers be Tradeſmen, as Shoemakers, Black-Smiths,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56692:155"/>and the like. And there is not any one that dares to ſtrike one of thoſe Souldiers, unleſs he be one himſelf, and unleſs he will have his Hand cut off: nay its remarkable, that they are not Cenſurable by the <hi>Cady's,</hi> or ordinary Judges, but onely by the <hi>Aga,</hi> or his <hi>Chaia,</hi> that is, his Lieutenant.</p>
                     <p>The Muſquet and Simiter, are the Arms which they uſe to carry, when they go unto the Wars, or to fetch in Contributions, or to play the Pyrates, and not otherwiſe. We are to adde here, that of the number of theſe <hi>Oldachy's,</hi> or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Janizaries,</hi> the <hi>Aga</hi> ſelects Four, which they call <hi>Sotachy's,</hi> who ſerve for a Guard to the <hi>Baſhaw:</hi> and theſe have their Lodgings and their Table in his Palace, and withall, theſe onely are allowed to wear Simiters; and that they may be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, they have upon their <hi>Turbans</hi> a kind of little Tower of Gilded Copper, and a very high Plume made of <hi>Herons</hi> Feathers.</p>
                     <p>That which is very obſervable in this <hi>Militia,</hi> is, that it being compounded of a great many Men of different Nations, as namely <hi>Turks, Greeks, French, Spaniards, Italians, Flemings, Engliſh, Germans,</hi> and others; yet their Policy is for all that ſo good, that they all live in great Concord, and very rarely Quarrel each other. But if amongſt them any one chance to lay hand on his Simiter, be it by Rencounter, or otherwiſe, with a deſign to ſtrike, then all that be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are obliged to make in unto him to hinder his doing any more, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him to the <hi>Divan</hi> to be puniſhed.</p>
                     <p>I will adde here one notable paſſage,
<note place="margin">An Inſtance of <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that reproacheth the uncharitableneſs of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                        </note> to make it appear how much eſteem theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> have for all thoſe in general who receive Pay, and are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in this <hi>Militia.</hi> Some years ſince it happened, that amongſt ſundry Lions which were Tamed, and went up and down the Streets of <hi>Algier,</hi> there was one which entred into the Court where the <hi>Divan</hi> was ſitting; and there before the whole Aſſembly he threw himſelf at the Feet of the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fawn upon him, moaning in a ſorrowful Tone, as if he did complain: The <hi>Baſhaw</hi> inſtantly gueſſed, that this Lion ſuffered hunger, and that having no particular Maſter, (for he was in common, and lay in the Streets) no one had took care to give him Food: whereupon, by conſent of the <hi>Divan,</hi> he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that for the time to come, that Lyon ſhould have the Pay of a <hi>Janizary,</hi> to be employed for his ſuſtenance: but the Lion chancing to die a Moneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was Decreed in full <hi>Divan,</hi> that he ſhould be ſolemnly Interred, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by four <hi>Janizaries,</hi> in memory of that that he had been of their <hi>Militia,</hi> and received Pay as themſelves.</p>
                     <p>¶ THe next thing is their Civil Government, their method of managing affairs of State, which is by the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> and <hi>Divan;</hi> yet herein differ they from all other: for the Divine <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaking of the felicity of States, hath ſaid with as much reaſon as truth, that they would then be happy when the Philoſophers ſhould be Kings, or Kings would Philoſophate. But the State of <hi>Algier</hi> ſeemeth directly to oppoſe that Doctrine; for that thoſe who have the Government thereof have very few of thoſe Qualities which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to Wiſdom. And yet nevertheleſs, as if Fortune had taken up her dwelling in that City, ſhe makes it to grow and proſper from day to day, both in Wealth and Power, if ſo be one may call that Proſperity which ſubſiſts onely by Vice, and which hath no other Foundation than Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Divan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their Government.</note> to ſpeak properly, is the Council of State, as well of the City, as of the whole Kingdom. It is compoſed of all the Officers of the <hi>Militia,</hi>
                        <pb n="229" facs="tcp:56692:155"/>and ſits four times a Week; namely, on Saturday, which is the day of the Great <hi>Divan,</hi> Sunday, Munday, and Tueſday. The firſt day in the <hi>Alcaſſaw,</hi> and the three others in the great Court of the <hi>Baſhaw</hi>'s Houſe. He himſelf, as great as he is, cannot be preſent there, unleſs he be ſent for in the Name of the <hi>Divan,</hi> by is <hi>Chiaus,</hi> or <hi>Huiſhers,</hi> who go on purpoſe to his Lodgings to advertiſe him thereof; and at the foot of the Stairs, where they ſtay, they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute him three times, as if they ſpoke to one that was deaf. I ſhall next let you ſee the Order and Placing of the Officers.</p>
                     <p n="1">The <hi>Aga,</hi> who is Chief of the Council, and of all the <hi>Militia;</hi> he is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt honorable Place, as Preſident, and propoſeth all that is to be put to the Debate, and to be reſolv'd on in full Aſſembly. And if the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> be call'd in, he ſingly reports his opinion as one of the reſt, but can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of nothing by his Authority.</p>
                     <p n="2">The Clerk or Secretary of the <hi>Divan,</hi> who writeth all that is there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and keepeth a Regiſter thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">The twenty four <hi>Ajabachy's,</hi> who are Officers of the <hi>Militia,</hi> neareſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the Dignity of <hi>Aga.</hi> They are ſeated in the ſame Court along a Gallery, in which each takes his place, according to the Seniority of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
                     <p n="4">The <hi>Boulouchbachy's,</hi> who may diſpute, and give their Votes, as the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">The <hi>Odabachy's,</hi> and ſometimes alſo the <hi>Manſulaga's,</hi> who are Summon'd when great Affairs of State are under deliberation.</p>
                     <p n="6">The <hi>Chiaus</hi> of the <hi>Divan;</hi> and theſe by the duty of their Charge, are preſent to execute the Orders and Commands of Council, which for the moſt part conſiſts of about ſeven or eight hundred Perſons. For the principal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the <hi>Militia</hi> have their places in it, and all of them that are in Town uſe to be preſent; ſo that ſometimes there will be in this <hi>Divan</hi> above fifteen hundred Perſons; eſpecially when all the Officers are there, the <hi>Manſulaga's</hi> and the <hi>Odabachy's</hi> are taken in. Theſe later, and the <hi>Boulouchbachy's,</hi> who make the greateſt number of Councellors of State, and Officers, do ſtand in the midſt of the Court-yard, each according to his Rank. They continue there ſometimes ſix or ſeven hours, in the Sun, in the Rain, and in the Wind, each with his Hands acroſs upon one another, without being permitted to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that poſture of them, ſave upon ſome neceſſity; nor to bring thither any Arms, not ſo much as a Dagger, for fear of any tumult. Thoſe who have any buſineſs there, be they <hi>Chriſtians, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Moors,</hi> may ſtand at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Court, up and down which certain <hi>Chiaus's</hi> paſs to and again with Pots full of Water, to offer thoſe to drink that deſire it.</p>
                     <p>All the Affairs of this <hi>Divan,</hi> are propounded and reſolv'd in the <hi>Turkiſh Tongue;</hi> ſo that there is a neceſſity that all the Officers do underſtand and ſpeak it; otherwiſe they cannot be admitted into the ſame. And this is practiſed amongſt them, thereby to teſtifie how much they value and eſteem the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire. And for this cauſe it is, that they have always in the <hi>Divan</hi> an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of Languages, of which they ordinarily make uſe to underſtand the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> when they have any Complaint or Petition to preſent: there being no Nation in that place, which hath not his <hi>Truchment</hi> to explain his thoughts. Theſe Officers and Councellors of State being in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aſſembled, the <hi>Aga</hi> propoundeth with an audible voice that which is then to be debated, addreſſing himſelf firſt to the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> if he be preſent, and to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56692:156"/>the twenty four <hi>Ajabachy's:</hi> Which being done, he puts the thing to the Vote of the whole <hi>Divan,</hi> and requires their opinion and reſolution in the Caſe; which is taken in this manner.</p>
                     <p>After that the four Officers, which are call'd <hi>Bachouldala'es,</hi> have heard the Propoſal of the <hi>Aga,</hi> they make it to be underſtood to the whole <hi>Divan</hi> in a loud voice, without ſtirring from their places. The word thus paſt unto the laſt of the Officers, remounts from one to another, with a ſtrange voice and murmuration, when it happens that the thing doth not pleaſe the aſſembly. And that being done, the <hi>Aga</hi> giveth his Determinations according as the Vote was for or againſt the Propoſal that he made. In the mean time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt this confus'd variety of Opinions, they obſerve not for the greater part of the time either Order or Law; but are conſtrain'd to conclude the Affair indifferently either with Juſtice or Injuſtice, as it beſt pleaſeth theſe goodly Councellors; who being for the moſt part Mechanicks, know not how either to write or read: ſo that conſequently in their ridiculous Advice they are guided onely by the motion of their Paſſion, and of their bruitiſh Ignorance; wherein ſometimes they fall to hot Conteſts. As parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon the Twenty ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Year One thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty four, there happened to ariſe a great Difference betwixt the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi> and the Aſſembly. The noiſe thereof was ſuch, or to ſay better, the howlings were ſo great, that no man ever heard any thing ſo frightful. In this Commotion they puſht one the other, with deſign to ruſh upon the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw;</hi> and ſeem'd to argue with each other, who ſhould be the firſt that ſhould lift up his arm to ſtrike. For it is a Cuſtom, that he that beginneth the Tumult, in lifting up his hands which he holdeth acroſs in the Aſſembly, is ſure, that, whether he have right on his ſide or no, he ſhall be ſeiz'd on, and put into a Sack, and thrown into the Sea. Which yet did not happen at that time, for that in the end the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> and the <hi>Aga</hi> found out a way to appeaſe the Tumult.</p>
                     <p>Where it is farther to be noted, that the Women who have Complaints to offer, aſſemble ſometimes to the number of an hundred of their Kinſwomen and Friends, who all veil'd repair to the Gate of the <hi>Divan,</hi> and there cry, <hi>Charala,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> and are very readily heard.</p>
                     <p>¶ IN the laſt place, we will briefly give an Account of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, when he beſieg'd this City; and of the great Loſs he ſuffer'd therein.</p>
                     <p>This Prince in the Year One thouſand five hundred forty one,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth beſieges <hi>Algier.</hi>
                        </note> having Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued upon the Sea an Army of Twenty two thouſand Men aboard Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Gallies, and an hundred tall Ships, not counting the Barques and Shallops, and other ſmall Boats, in which he had engaged the principal of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Nobility, with a good number of the Knights of <hi>Maltha;</hi> he was to Land on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> at a Cape call'd <hi>Matifou.</hi> From this Place unto the City of <hi>Algier</hi> a flat Shore or Strand extends it ſelf for about four Leagues, the which is exceeding favourable to Gallies. There he put aſhore with his Army, and in a few days cauſed a Fortreſs to be built, which unto this day is call'd <hi>The Caſtle of the Emperor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time the City of <hi>Algier</hi> took the Alarm, having in it at that time but Eight hundred <hi>Turks,</hi> and Six thouſand <hi>Moors,</hi> poor-ſpirited men, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſed in Martial affairs; beſides it was at that time Fortifi'd onely with
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56692:156"/>Walls, and had no Out-works: Inſomuch that by reaſon of its weakneſs; and the great Forces of the Emperour, it could not in appearance eſcape taking. In fine, it was Attaqued with ſuch Order, that the Army came up to the very Gates, where the Chevalier <hi>de Sauignac,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman</hi> by Nation, made himſelf remarkable above all the reſt, by the miracles of his Valour. For having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed the <hi>Turks,</hi> who having made a Sally at the Gate call'd <hi>Babaſon,</hi> and there deſiring to enter along with them, when he ſaw that they ſhut the Gate upon him, he ran his Ponyard into the ſame, and left it ſticking deep therein. They next fell to Battering the City by the Force of Cannon; which the Aſſailants ſo weakened, that in that great extremity the Defendants loſt their Courage, and reſolved to ſurrender.</p>
                     <p>But as they were thus intending, there was a Witch of the Town,
<note place="margin">His Fleet and Army o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, and wrack'd by Witchcraft.</note> whom the Hiſtory doth not name, which went to ſeek out <hi>Aſſam Aga,</hi> that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded within, and pray'd him to make it good yet nine Days longer, with aſſurance, that within that time he ſhould infallibly ſee <hi>Algier</hi> delivered from that Siege, and the whole Army of the Enemy diſperſed, ſo that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould be as cheap as Birds. In a word, the thing did happen in the manner as foretold; for upon the Twenty firſt day of <hi>October</hi> in the ſame Year, there fell a continual Rain upon the Land, and ſo furious a Storm at Sea, that one might have ſeen Ships hoiſted into the Clouds, and in one inſtant again precipitated into the bottom of the Water: inſomuch that that ſame dreadful Tempeſt was followed with the loſs of fifteen Gallies, and above an hundred other Veſſels; which was the cauſe why the Emperour, ſeeing his Army waſted by the bad Weather, purſued by a Famine, occaſioned by wrack of his Ships, in which was the greateſt part of his Victuals and Ammunition, he was conſtrain'd to raiſe the Siege, and ſet Sail for <hi>Sicily,</hi> whither he Retreated with the miſerable Reliques of his Fleet.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time that Witch being acknowledged the Deliverer of <hi>Algier,</hi> was richly remunerated, and the Credit of her Charms authorized. So that ever ſince Witchcraft hath been very freely tolerated; of which the Chief of the Town, and even thoſe who are eſteem'd to be of greateſt Sanctity among them, ſuch as are the <hi>Marabou's,</hi> a Religious Order of their Sect, do for the moſt part make Profeſſion of it, under a goodly Pretext of certain Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they ſay they have had from their Prophet <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hereupon thoſe of <hi>Algier,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">But the <hi>Algeriant</hi> will not own it.</note> to palliate the ſhame and the reproaches that are thrown upon them for making uſe of a Witch in the danger of this Siege, do ſay, that the loſs of the Forces of <hi>Charles</hi> V. was cauſed by a Prayer of one of their <hi>Marabou's,</hi> named <hi>Cidy Utica,</hi> which was at that time in great Credit, not under the notion of a <hi>Magitian,</hi> but for a perſon of a holy life. Afterwards in remembrance of their ſucceſs, they have erected unto him a ſmall <hi>Moſque</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Babaſon</hi> Gate, where he is buried, and in which they keep ſundry Lamps burning in honour of him: nay they ſometimes repair thither to make their <hi>Sala,</hi> for a teſtimony of greater Veneration.</p>
                     <p>Here one thing very well merits our obſervation,
<note place="margin">Note.</note> that in the Year One thouſand ſix hundred thirty ſeven, in the end of <hi>November,</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Algier</hi> took an exact ſurvey of the Mole of their Port in the time of a great Calm, fearing the ſtrong Preparations of the <hi>French,</hi> wherewith they had been mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the <hi>Sieur de Manly,</hi> they to their great aſtoniſhment, perceived without, and ſomewhat above the Mole, a Galley at the bottom of the Water, where it lay covered with Sand from Poop to Prow, with all its Banks of Oars. Now
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56692:157"/>in regard none living had ſeen or heard ſpeak of ſuch a Galley, it did much aſtoniſh every one, and invited moſt people to go to ſee it. To raiſe it entire there was no way, but all they could do was to get up three very fair and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Canon, and by the Arms of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth upon them, it was imagined to be a part of the Wreck of his Fleet an hundred years before, as we but now mentioned.</p>

                     <p>¶ THe Soil is ſo fruitful,
<note place="margin">The Soil of the Countrey.</note> that ſometimes there are two or three Harveſts in a year, of Wheat, Barley, and Oats; beſides other Plants, which it affords the whole year in great abundance. They have in ſome places Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, very delicious in Taſte; ſome of which are ripe while others are green; ſo that all Seaſons produce ſucceſſively ripe Melons: Beſides Vines, whereon hang bunches of Grapes a Cubit long.</p>

<note place="margin">The Beaſts.</note> Leopards, Tygers, Panthers, Porcupines, and Hedge-Hogs, whoſe fleſh the <hi>Moors</hi> eat, though Swines Fleſh be forbidden; Harts, Apes, Foxes, Camelions, and many ſorts of Fowls, <hi>viz.</hi> Oſtriches, Eagles, Hens, Partridges, and the like: Oxen alſo with ſtraight Horns an Ell long, and Sheep with three, four, five, or ſix Horns, and Tails thirty, forty, or fifty pound weight, beſides Horſes and Camels.</p>
                     <p>Here are alſo two ſtrange Beaſts; the one call'd a <hi>Gapard,</hi> the other a <hi>Cicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:</hi> the former frequently made tame, as <hi>Gramay</hi> ſays, and us'd to hunt with by reaſon of its ſwiftneſs; it hath a Head like a Cat, but much bigger, a ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Tail like a Panther, the Feet behind longer and higher than thoſe before; one main cauſe of his great ſpeed in running. The other neither a Dog nor a Fox, but partaking of both; having one peculiar and rare property to cure Lameneſs with his Breath, if the ſame be taken in the morning upon the hand, and that apply'd to the part affected, chafing the ſame.</p>

                     <p>The King and the Grandees of the Court, wear their Beards long; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhave cloſe, cutting off withal the Hair of their Heads, excepting one Lock on the Crown, by which they believe they ſhall be drawn up to Paradiſe. They Bathe often, and Waſh every Morning before they do any thing; then again before their <hi>Sala,</hi> or Prayer; alſo before Dinner: at each Lotion the Water is pour'd into the Palms of their Hand, which they ſuffer, or rather cauſe to run up to their Elbows.</p>
                     <p>¶ MOſt of the Houſes are built Four-ſquare, two, three, four,

                     <p>The Palaces of the Kings and other Grandees, have great Quadrangles, beautifi'd with curious Columns; the Floors of the Rooms Boarded, ſpread over with Tapeſtry, into which whoever goes, leaves his Shoes ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Door.</p>

                     <p>The Common People wear in the Winter over their Shirts, a Linen or Woollen pair of Drawers, a white Woollen Coat, with a white Cap faſtened behind, call'd <hi>Galela;</hi> others have a Garment on hanging down to their Knees, which they throw over their Shoulders, and under their Arms, like a Cloak, call'd <hi>Golela,</hi> commonly Dy'd Black. In the Summer they have two large Frocks, or Coats on, which they call <hi>Adorta:</hi> upon their Head is a <hi>Turban</hi> of ſlight Linnen, or Cotton-Cloth.</p>

                     <p>The Apparel of the Women differs little from that of the Men, onely they are much ſtatelier and thinner; their Shifts come down to their Ankles, their Hair braided and ty'd up with Necklaces of Gold, Bracelets of the ſame, rich Pendants and Jewels in their Ears, and ſquare Caps on their Heads. When they go abroad, they have a Vail or Mantle of fine Linnen hanging over their Heads, and claſp'd on their Breaſts, ſo that nothing can be ſeen but their eyes; but in the Houſe they wear a Silk Frock over their Linnen Shift.</p>

                     <p>¶ HEre is a Cuſtom deviating a little from the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their Marriage.</note> the reſtraining Men to four Wives, whiles this gives liberty for as many as one pleaſes; but the <hi>Algerines</hi> are oblig'd by their Cuſtom, and keep within the compaſs of four Wives; but their wanton luſts towards Concubines and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamites</hi> are unbridl'd, and without limitation: Others aſſume the liberty of ſeven, among whom they divide the nights, and allow every one a ſeveral Chamber; but this produces heart-burnings and jealouſies which many times prove fatal to either, or both.</p>

This laſt hath the greateſt trouble, becauſe for the moſt part they continue out ſix or ſeven Moneths.</p>
                     <p>Every Troop is commanded by an <hi>Aga,</hi> who is as much as a Collonel; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Command and Conduct they forceably Collect thoſe Tributes among the <hi>Moors,</hi> wilde <hi>Arabs, Advares</hi> and <hi>Alarbs,</hi> who pay nothing but by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion. For this Oppreſſion and Tyranny they are generally hated, and the people certainly knowing the time of their coming, oftentimes break up their Tents, and drive all their Cattel before them into the Mountains where the Convenience or Strength of the Place gives them hope to have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of avoiding their Cruelty. Theſe Marches are contrived always to begin in Harveſt; but if it happen they can get neither Money nor Coyn, they ſecure themſelves by taking their Cattel and Corn, and ſometimes their Children. All the gather'd Tributes are brought to <hi>Algier,</hi> and a particular Accompt thereof given in the <hi>Divan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some perhaps at firſt hearing may wonder how one of theſe Troops, at moſt not above three hundred ſtrong, can ſo eaſily run down the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; but his own recollected thoughts will eaſily rectifie him, when he ſhall conſider, the one are ignorant of Martial Diſcipline, and that breeds in them a want of courage, neither know how to manage thoſe few Arms they have;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56692:160"/>whereas the other are compleatly arm'd, well diſciplin'd, and daily exercis'd in the Wars.</p>
                     <p>The Regiſter or Secretary of the <hi>Divan</hi> hath the Command or Check of thoſe Troops, of whom he always hath a Liſt or Muſter-Roll; by which knowing every mans Quality and Service, he accordingly puts him upon Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And when they go out to fetch Contribution, though they be all Foot-Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, yet are they allow'd Horſes as well as their Officers; onely with this difference, the Commanders have Slaves to look to their Horſes, which the others may not.</p>
                     <p>When they draw out of <hi>Algier,</hi> they Rendezvouz about the City, lying in Tents till they meet together.</p>
                     <p>But when they march, they commonly have their Allowance of Bread, with a little Oyl, Vinegar, Rice, and Couſcous. What other Proviſions they will have, they muſt buy with their own Money; but that they take no great care for, as well enough knowing how to fetch Victuals abundantly from the <hi>Arabs</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi> The greateſt gain thoſe Companiess make, ariſeth from the Oſtridge Feathers they bring from the Wilderneſſes in the South, which upon their return they ſell very dear.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Corſairs</hi> or Pyrates, the beſt account that can be given of them, is from the great number of their Ships wherewith they put to Sea; which amount to thirty five in all: A Liſt of which, with the Names of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Commanders as they were in the Year 1668. and what each Ship carries in her Stern, with the number of Guns, we have here inſerted, as followeth.</p>

                     <p>This much troubling <hi>Barbaroſſa,</hi> that he had ſo diſhonourably forſaken ſuch an Enterpriſe, having recover'd his Wound, in the Year Fifteen hundred and fourteen he renew'd the former Siege; in which plying the Caſtle ſo hot, and ſhaking it with his great Cannon, it fell; but the Garriſon'd Souldiers retir'd into the City. Then inſtantly he apply'd himſelf to the Storming of the other Caſtle, and without doubt would have carried it, though in the firſt Aſſault there remain'd an hundred <hi>Turks,</hi> and as many <hi>Moors</hi> dead upon the Spot, had not <hi>Martin de Reuteria,</hi> with five Ships, and a competent number of Souldiers, came opportunely to their Aſſiſtance into the Haven: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> was once more compell'd to depart to <hi>Gigeri. Charles</hi> the Fifth Emperour, ſeeing of what great conſequence it was to keep this place for the more eaſie Conqueſt of <hi>Algier,</hi> for the better Security thereof, built a Fort upon the Hill which commanded the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>At length thoſe of <hi>Algier,</hi> after many fruitleſs Attempts, became Maſters thereof in the Year Fifteen hundred fifty and five, by the Conduct of the <hi>Baſſa Sala,</hi> who with three thouſand <hi>Turks,</hi> and thirty thouſand <hi>Moors,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer'd in two places both the Caſtles as well by Land as Water. Firſt he gain'd the Caſtle lying on the Sea, cutting off moſt of the Defendants, then ſlighting it, and purſuing his Succeſs, fell upon the other Fort with ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Lieutenant <hi>Alonſo de Peralta</hi> was forc'd to deſert it, and ſeek Refuge in the City; but conſidering the weakneſs of the Town, as not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure an Attaque, ſurrendred the City, Shipping thence (according to Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles)

<note place="margin">The ſeveral Names.</note> as by its diſtance of three miles from <hi>Carthage, Titus Livius</hi> declares. <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> call it <hi>Tynis,</hi> or <hi>Tunis;</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy, Themiſe:</hi> ſome will have it, but without any reaſon, to be <hi>Teniſſum,</hi> lying by the <hi>Numidian Sea,</hi> which in truth ſtands thirty miles from it: Others ſtray as wide from the mark, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> to be one and the ſame place. The <hi>Italians</hi> call it <hi>Tuniſi</hi> and <hi>Tunis;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch, Tunus,</hi> or <hi>Tunis;</hi> and the <hi>Arabians, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Moors, Tunus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>¶ IT lieth upon an Inlet of the Lake <hi>Gouletta,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Scituation.</note> three miles to the North of the antient <hi>Carthage,</hi> and two miles from the <hi>Mediterranean Sea,</hi> ſurrounded on the South with high Mountains: The form of it is an Oblong-ſquare, and in bigneſs, about a ſmall mile in compaſs, though <hi>Gramay</hi> enlarge it to three, and others to five <hi>Spaniſh</hi> mile, environed with a Wall of forty Cubits high, ſtrengthened with many Turrets; before the laſt Aſſault made upon it by the <hi>Turks,</hi> there were many Bulwarks and Forts, but moſt of them are ſince ſlighted.</p>
                     <p>¶ THe principal Gates in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue call'd <hi>Bab,</hi> are five, <hi>viz.
<note place="margin">The Gates.</note> Bab Vaſouque, Bab Carthago, Bab Elbaar, Bab Aſſeire,</hi> and <hi>Bab Efmenar,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeveral other Poſterns. Formerly they reckoned herein eighteen emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Streets, beſides divers Lanes, all very narrow, ſixteen Markets, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifteen <hi>Moſques,</hi> and twelve <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches; beſides in the Suburbs eight <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues, four and twenty <hi>Hermits</hi> Chappels, a hundred and fifty Bathes, eighty ſix Schools, nine endowed Colledges, ſixty four Hoſpitals, or Inns for Travellers and Strangers, and above three thouſand Shops, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56692:171"/>in were ſold Woollen and Linnen Cloth; of all which at preſent there are but few remains.</p>
                     <p>¶ THere are ſeven Priſons,
<note place="margin">The Priſons,</note> where they ſhut up <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves, call'd in <hi>French, Bagnes;</hi> or <hi>Bafios, viz.</hi> the <hi>Bayne</hi> of <hi>Iſſouf Dey,</hi> the <hi>Bayne</hi> of <hi>Morat Bey,</hi> the <hi>Bayne</hi> of the <hi>Patron,</hi> another of <hi>Solyman,</hi> a fifth of <hi>Sidi Mamet,</hi> the ſixth of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> and laſtly that of <hi>Sigale.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>¶ Among all the Edifices of the City,
<note place="margin">The Palace.</note> the Palace is the moſt eminent, where the <hi>Baſſa</hi> keeps his Court, beautifi'd with four ſtately <hi>Portico</hi>'s, ſeveral Towers, a pleaſant ſquare Court, fair and delightful Gardens, and magnificent Cloiſters, Chambers and Halls; but above all, the Treaſury-Chamber is coſtly, wherein the King formerly kept the Book of their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Elmuachdin,</hi> or <hi>Elmohadian,</hi> of which they boaſted as the onely Reconciler of all Differences riſing about their Law.</p>
                     <p>There ſtands alſo a Caſtle on the Weſt ſide of the City upon a Mount; as alſo a great <hi>Moſque,</hi> call'd <hi>Ameth Benaros,</hi> built by King <hi>Zacharias,</hi> to the Honor of one of their <hi>Santons,</hi> ſerving for a Refuge or Sanctuary for Offenders; and had a Tower that was held the moſt famous in all <hi>Africa.</hi> There is alſo a Quarter for the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> a Burſe or Exchange for Merchants, and a Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. The other Buildings of moſt remark, are the Palaces of <hi>Aga Sidi la Fes,</hi> of <hi>Sidi Mahometa Milanoys,</hi> of <hi>Sidi Jucip Rais,</hi> and many others.</p>
                     <p>¶ THe Citizens Houſes,
<note place="margin">The Houſes.</note> 
                        <hi>Gramay</hi> and <hi>Sanutus</hi> ſay, amounted formerly to ten thouſand; but much increas'd by the <hi>Moors</hi> that were driven out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſettling here, have fill'd it with all ſorts of Artificers and Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts; by which means it is full of Trade, and will compare with many of our beſt Cities in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Houſes were heretofore built very artificially, with all ſorts of Imagery, wrought both in Stone and Plaiſter, and curiouſly painted; the Floor of the Chambers pav'd with ſmooth and ſhining Stones; the Roofs flat; but moſt of them onely one Story high: This was its Antient Beauty: But at preſent they are ſlightly built, generally having two Doors or Gates, one to the Street, and another to the backward places; between which they have a ſmall Gallery, chiefly us'd as an Apartment for Friends that come to viſit them.</p>
                     <p>In the Year Fifteen hundred and twenty,
<note place="margin">Suburbs <hi>Gram</hi> 8. <hi>b.</hi> 1. <hi>H.</hi>
                        </note> there were three Suburbs; one without the Gate <hi>Bedſuvaike,</hi> containing about three hundred Houſes; another without the Gate <hi>Bebelmanora,</hi> ſhewing a thouſand Habitations of Tradeſmen; and the third without the Gate of <hi>Beb-el Bachar,</hi> a quarter of a mile from the <hi>Lake Golette,</hi> having three hundred low and ſmall Houſes, wherein the <hi>Venetians, Genoueſes,</hi> and other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> reſide, that they may not intermingle with the <hi>Moors.</hi> But now there are onely two, one on the Weſt towards <hi>Biſerta,</hi> very fair and large; the other on the Eaſt towards <hi>Souſa:</hi> Without the City are the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-Grounds of the <hi>Turks,</hi> wherein are many Marble Monuments, and great variety of curious Flowers.</p>
                     <p>¶ THis City hath neither Wells,
<note place="margin">The Water.</note> Rivers, nor Springs of freſh Water, but only Ciſterns, wherein they Catch the Rain-water: 'Tis true, there is one Well, ſometimes affording pleaſant Water; but with great diligence kept for the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> and his Family.</p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:56692:171"/>
                     <p>But ſome years ſince <hi>Iſſouf Dey</hi> brought Water thither from a Fountain a mile without the City, through a ſtone Channel, or arch'd Sewer, appointing for the maintenance thereof two <hi>Eſcues</hi> yearly.</p>
                     <p>In the Suburbs there is a Well of Brackiſh-Water, which the Slaves bring to the City and ſell; making thereof good profit, the People accounting it much wholeſomer than the Rain-water in the Ciſterns.</p>
                     <p>¶ <hi>ANani</hi> ſays, The Soyl on the Weſt ſide, is reaſonably Fertile,
<note place="margin">The Soyl.</note> having ſome Rivers to water it: But on the Eaſt ſide, for want of Water, very little worth. But <hi>Peter Dan</hi> avers, that on the South-ſide, where it lies ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Mountains, it hath very Fruitful-Valleys, but in all the other Parts very Dry and Sandy. <hi>Gramay</hi> and <hi>Sanutus</hi> report, that cloſe by, the Ground is ſo Dry, that it had need be continually watered. This want of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with the frequent Incurſions of the <hi>Alarbes,</hi> makes the Corn at <hi>Tunis</hi> very dear. The People in the Suburbs being neceſſitated to Wall in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Spots of Ground, wherein to Sow Barley and Rye, to preſerve it from their Pillage.</p>
                     <p>¶ ORanges, Lemmons, Dates, and ſuch like Fruit, grow here plentifully;
<note place="margin">The Plants or Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> ſo alſo Olives for a mile round about the City, which afford Oyl, not onely for the Natives but Foreigners; and their Wood they burn in ſtead of other Fewel. <hi>Borbo</hi> produces Roſes and other ſweet-ſmelling Flowers. The high Mountain <hi>Zagoan,</hi> Barley and Honey. <hi>Genſlet</hi> yields Apples, and <hi>St. Johns-Bread;</hi> but <hi>Benitefren</hi> and <hi>Naifuſe,</hi> onely Barley, and but little of that.</p>
                     <p>¶ THe whole Countrey, eſpecially the Mountainous Parts,
<note place="margin">Beaſts.</note> are full of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wild Bulls and Cows, Oſtriches, Apes, Camelions, Neat, allow-Deer, Hares, Pheſants; beſides ſuch abundance of Horſes and Camels, that they bear little or no price.</p>
                     <p>¶ THe People of <hi>Tunis</hi> are <hi>Moors, Turks, Jews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Inhabitants.</note> and Slaves of ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, taken by their Pyrates in the <hi>Mediterrane,</hi> and brought thither.</p>
                     <p>Here are alſo a ſort of Men that Laze up and down the Streets bare-headed, and bare-footed, with Stones in their Hands, like Mad or Diſtracted Folks, whoſe careleſs Madneſs hath won ſuch a reputation upon the folly of the Vulgar, that they not onely account them Saints, but allow them a ſettled Maintenance at the Publick Charge.</p>
                     <p>¶ THeir Cloathing is according to the beſt Faſhion of their Countrey,
<note place="margin">Their Cloathing.</note> each in his ſeveral Degree; but all wear <hi>Turbans,</hi> made and covered with Linnen or other Stuff, after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner. Womens Habits, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the better ſort, are very neat, and richly adorn'd with Jewels: when they go into the Street they cover their Faces with a great Cloth, over which they caſt another, which they call <hi>Setfari:</hi> theſe multifarious Coverings, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance make them appear of a much larger Size than ordinary: When they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at home, they ſpend the greateſt part of their Time and Means in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Perfumes, and other like Trifles, not minding Huſwifery, or any other profitable Employments.</p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:56692:172"/>
                     <p>¶ THeir Bread is for the moſt part made of Wheat,
<note place="margin">Their Food.</note> though the vulgar uſe Barley; which in ſtead of kneading with Hands they beat with Battoons. The common Diet of Merchants, Artificers, and the like, is but a courſe Food, call'd <hi>Beſis,</hi> made of Barley-meal and Water, like Pap or Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; to which they give a <hi>Haut-gouſt</hi> with Oyl-Olive, and Juice of Lemmons and Oranges, which they buy in the Market appointed for the Sale thereof, and nothing elſe. Beſides this they eat alſo Fleſh, eſpecially that of Lambs: but more than theſe another kind of Diſh they have, in the eating whereof they take great pleaſure, the common known Name is <hi>Laſis;</hi> of which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eats two Ounces, is ſo far from ſatisfying his Stomach therewith, that it rather augments it to a kind of <hi>Caninus appetitus,</hi> or unſatisfied voraciouſneſs, attended with a continual Laughing, and other antick Geſtures, till at length they fall into the extravagancies of a luſtful Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>¶ IN this City are all manner of Handicrafts,
<note place="margin">Their Employment.</note> but chiefly Linnen-Weavers, whoſe skill in their Trade was ſuch as made their Cloth of great repute, both for ſtrength and fineneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Mountaineers deal onely in Cattel, living in Hutts, which they draw together to the number of a hundred or two hundred, wherewith they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually range about and change Places, as their Cattel want freſh Paſture.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Hutt-Villages ſtand in order, with ways and paſſages between, all leading to a great Field in the midſt where the Cattel feed. On the out-ſides they ſtand ſo cloſe, that they are like a Wall, paſſable onely at two Entrances, the one for the Cattel, and the other for the Men; and theſe in the Nights ſo ſecured with Trees, Thorns, and the like, that they neither fear Lyons, nor other wild Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>¶ THe King or <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of <hi>Tunis</hi> receives Annually two hundred thouſand <hi>Ducats;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their Reverue.</note> beſides the Cuſtom upon Olives and Linnen; Exported Wheat, heretofore amounted to forty thouſand <hi>Ducats</hi> more. Others reckon that the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> Letts the Lands and Cuſtoms for five hundred thouſand <hi>Eſcues,</hi> or <hi>French Crowns.</hi> The whole Revenue ſeems to ariſe to more than two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand <hi>Ducats</hi> yearly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter Dan</hi> ſays,
<note place="margin">Peter Dan.</note> that the Revenue of this Kingdom is but accidental and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, accrewing chiefly, not from any ſtanding In-come, but onely from the Fiſhery, which yields a Rent yearly of thirty thouſand <hi>Ryalls of Eight,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> Poll-money; all the reſt raiſed out of the Prizes of the Ships taken by the <hi>Corſaires</hi> of <hi>Tunis</hi> in the <hi>Mediterrane</hi> from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which yield Ten in the Hundred; as alſo from the Tributes and Taxes, which with Flying Parties they fetch from the Land of the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>¶ THe Inhabitants are not Rich either in Banks or Stocks,

                     </p>
                     <p>¶ THeir principal Merchandiſe is,
<note place="margin">Their Merchandiſe.</note> as we ſaid before, Linnen-Cloth, which is there made in great quantities, and carried all over <hi>Africa;</hi> ſo Oyl, Olives, Sheep, Oſtritches and Horſes, from which they raiſe great Gain.</p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:56692:172"/>
                     <p>¶ THe Native <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Kings of the Countreys firſt ſtamped here Gold <hi>Sultanies,</hi> or <hi>Ducats,</hi> greater by a third part than our <hi>European Ducats,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their Coyn.</note> and worth four and twenty <hi>Carraks.</hi> They have alſo a ſquare ſilver Coyn call'd <hi>Noſara,</hi> as alſo <hi>Aſpers</hi> and <hi>Duble's,</hi> and another call'd <hi>Borbas,</hi> of Copper, of the like value with thoſe of <hi>Algier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>¶ THe Government heretofore was Monarchical,
<note place="margin">Their Government.</note> and long continued in the Line of <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Kings, which were not by Election, but an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Succeſſion of the eldeſt Son of the deceaſed Kings; or for want of Sons, the next of Blood to the King, took the Dominion: But ſince their Expulſion by the <hi>Turks,</hi> the State is wholly altered, being at preſent Commanded by a <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> or <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> ſent thither from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> who Ruled with greater and more unlimited Authority than any other <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of the <hi>Great Turk</hi> in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca:</hi> He is aſſiſted with the Council, or <hi>Divan</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> the <hi>Aga,</hi> ſome chief Officers call'd <hi>Beniloukbaſſen,</hi> and four Counſellors, who wear upon their Heads a Hood with a Silver Horn.</p>
                     <p>¶ <hi>PEter Dan</hi> ſays this <hi>Baſhaw</hi> is changed every three year,
<note place="margin">Peter Dan.</note> and another ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Place; whoſe preſent Authority is much eclipſed, in that he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with nothing but the Receipts of the Revenue: that thoſe of <hi>Tunis</hi> elect a chief Officer of their own, with the Title of <hi>Dey,</hi> to whoſe care the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City is committed during his life, unleſs, which ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens for miſcarriages therein, diſplaced, and put to death. Other inferior Officers for the better Adminiſtration of Juſtice, are an upper <hi>Cadle,</hi> that is, a Marſhal, or rather a Sheriff, who appoints under him many Subſtitutes, who hear and determine all criminal Cauſes, and ſuch as relate to Life and Death, but not without apparent teſtimony. The occaſions of theſe alterations and new ſettlements have proceeded from ſeveral grounds, whereof we will give you a ſhort Narrative.</p>
                     <p>Not many years ſince, the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and other Souldiers in Pay, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſix or ſeven thouſand, partly <hi>Turks,</hi> and partly <hi>Renegado's,</hi> intermixt with <hi>Moors,</hi> combined together to bereave the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of his Command, and leave him nothing but the Honour and the Office to pay the <hi>Janizaries:</hi> in proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which Deſign they ſet up a <hi>Divan,</hi> or <hi>Council of State,</hi> like that of <hi>Algier,</hi> which undertook the Management of all matters of War. This continued till the Year fifteen hundred twenty four, when <hi>Kara Oſman,</hi> a Native <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizary,</hi> and formerly a Shoemaker by Trade, but very ſubtle and ambitious, ſo won the hearts of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> by Artifices and Preſents, that they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him their <hi>Chief,</hi> giving him the Title of <hi>Dey;</hi> ſo that thence-forward, neither the <hi>Divan</hi> nor <hi>Baſhaw</hi> himſelf durſt conclude any thing but with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the <hi>Dey</hi> and his Participants.</p>
                     <p>With the like abſolute Authority have all Succeſſive <hi>Deys</hi> governed, although the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> hath a Titular <hi>Baſhaw</hi> there, who is onely concern'd in the Revenue, as we mention'd before.</p>
                     <p>Neither at preſent do theſe <hi>Deyes</hi> undertake or conclude any matter of Concernment, till firſt communicated to the <hi>Divan;</hi>

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56692:173"/>not till they have firſt heard the Opinion of the <hi>Dey,</hi> whoſe ſingle Vote, though contrary to all their Judgements, is concluſive and binding. Subſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to theſe ſuperior Miniſters of State are many <hi>Cadies,</hi> who judge of leſſer Cauſes, to the great eaſe both of the <hi>Dey</hi> and his Council.

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Janizaries</hi> here tranſact all Affairs as thoſe in <hi>Algier,</hi> being diſtinguiſht neither by Commanders or Juſtice: Out of whom are yearly choſen two Field-Commanders to gather in the Cuſtom and Tributes of the <hi>Arabians;</hi> and for the increaſe of their Strength, ſome few <hi>Moors,</hi> by the name of <hi>Zovaners,</hi> are admitted into Pay.</p>
                     <p>¶ ANd here we ſhall ſuccinctly render an Account of the ſeveral Revolutions that have happen'd in the Government of this Kingdom. After that the <hi>Arabians,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Mahumetane Saracens,</hi> had brought a great part of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> and all <hi>Barbary,</hi> under their Command, and made <hi>Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> the Head-Seat of their Empire, they ſent hither <hi>Abelchit,</hi> an <hi>African</hi> by Birth, who being a man of an ambitious and daring ſpirit, and having withall a Strength an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable thereto, reſolv'd to take upon him Sovereign Rule, and accordingly ſettled his Court at <hi>Cairavan,</hi> about thirty miles from <hi>Old Carthage. Kaim,</hi> then <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> having intelligence of this Revolt, ſent thither a ſtrong Army, whoſe timely Arrival ſmother'd the Enterprize in the birth, though he had promis'd himſelf a more happy Fortune; yet was he not diſcourag'd or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,

                           <hi>Tunis</hi> is a Kingdom.</note> but that he tranſmitted to <hi>Hibraim,</hi> one of his Sons, the perfecting his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in part; for he ſoon after laid the Foundation of a new Kingdom in <hi>Tunis,</hi> there ſettling his Court, and making it the Metropolis of his Dominion.</p>
                     <p>This Kingdom <hi>Hibraim</hi> and his Succeſſors held a long time, with much Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity and Honor, till <hi>Joſeph</hi> King of <hi>Morocco</hi> made an Invaſion upon it; whoſe Succeſſors tracing the ſteps of his begun Attempt, never ceas'd till they got all: for <hi>Habdul Mumen</hi> having gain'd <hi>Mahadia</hi> from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in proceſs of time wore out the Race of <hi>Abelchit,</hi> and got the total Poſſeſſion thereof, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning it by Vice-Roys or Lieutenants,

                     </p>
                     <p>But after the Death of <hi>Mahumeth Ennaſir,</hi> Son of <hi>Manſor,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56692:177"/>with convenient Fodder for them, beſides Stabling for four thouſand Horſe, with Conveniencies of Stowage for their Provender, and ſufficient Quarters in thoſe Out-Streets for their Riders, and twenty thouſand Foot beſides, which never came into the City to trouble it. On the South-ſide ſtood the Caſtle of <hi>Byrſa,</hi> two miles and a half in Circuit; firſt built by <hi>Dido,</hi> as we ſaid, and in that the ſumptuous Temples of <hi>Juno, Apollo, Eſculapius,</hi> and <hi>Belus:</hi> On the Weſt a Mole, whoſe entrance was but ſeventy Foot, but within a ſtately <hi>Arſenall</hi> and Room for their Ships and Galleys to ride in ſafety. Thus commodiouſly ſeated, it conquer'd all the Sea-Coaſts from the greater <hi>Sirtes</hi> to the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and ſo to the River <hi>Iberus;</hi> wherein was contained three hundred Cities. Not contented here, they caſt an eye upon <hi>Sicily,</hi> whoſe defence the <hi>Romans</hi> (emulous of the <hi>Punick</hi> Greatneſs) undertook; which was the firſt <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> War, and ended to their diſadvantage, being forc'd to pay three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred Talents, amounting to two Millions of Crowns.</p>

               <p>That part of <hi>Biledulgerid</hi> that borders <hi>Lybia,</hi> yields but a ſmall Product, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing craggy and barren Mountains, whoſe Skirts are of as little value, bearing nothing but inconſiderable Shrubs, Brambles, and Thorns; a dry Sterility ruling over all for want of Water.</p>
               <p>¶ ALl <hi>Numidia</hi> is infected with various and deadly biting Serpents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
<note place="margin">The Beaſts.</note> and within with Scorpions as dangerous, which eſpecially rage in Summer, killing many: They have ſtore of Oſtriches, Camels, and Goats, and ſome breeds of Horſes. Their Corn-Harveſt falls in <hi>April,</hi> their Dates they gather in <hi>September,</hi> and the middle of <hi>October;</hi> but if Rain happens in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> they neither ſowe nor reap, but their ſtor'd up Dates, which are alwayes abundant, ſupplies the Effects of a bad Year; by which means, though the Seaſons prove intemperate, they know no Famine: yet though the Date grows there ſo plentifully, that they never lack, yet they would rather have a good Fruit-year than a Corn-year, becauſe the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Merchants and others bring them in ſtore of Grain, which they willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly barter for Dates. There groweth much of the Wood call'd <hi>Anil,</hi> ſo uſeful for Dying.</p>
               <p>Beſides ravening wilde Beaſts and venomous Serpents, they ſuffer alſo much by the moleſtation of an Eaſt-Wind, which raiſing ſuch Tempeſts of Sand, and beating on their Faces, gets into the Eyes of thoſe that travel, making them always blear'd and ſore; otherwiſe the Air of it ſelf is very healthy,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56692:190"/>and oftentimes for an hundred years together they know no Peſtilence, Small Pox, nor any other ſuch like Diſtempers.</p>
               <p>¶ THe Inhabitants of <hi>Numidia</hi> are generally long liv'd,
<note place="margin">The Conſtitution of the Inhabitants.</note> onely Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, in ſo high a manner, that their Teeth often drop out; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to proceed from their conſtant eating of Dates; whoſe ſweetneſs ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſſates the Blood, making ſlower the Circulation, that this their Diet ſeems to be the chief cauſe of that Diſtemper: They are alſo weak-ſighted, and much troubled with ſore Eyes, which accidentally happens from the Sandy Commotions carried on by the foremention'd noxious Eaſtern Winds. They are by Nature jealous, libidinous, and ignorant, not courting neither Knowledge or Learning, nor minding how to live in a plentiful manner; but though they are ſedentary and ſlothful, yet they are deceitful, treacherous, and murdering Robbers. But ſome few of this Region are not guilty of this their ſordid Condition, but are more generous, ingenious, very civil, and truly valiant.</p>
               <p>¶ THey eat much Camels Fleſh,
<note place="margin">Their Food.</note> and the Oſtrich they eſteem as a Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; their Drink is Camels Milk, and the Liquor in which the Fleſh is boil'd; not once ſo much as taſting clear Water.</p>
               <p>Amongſt their other Qualities, there are ſome that are ſo naſtily ſordid, that not onely they never waſh their Feet, but look upon it as an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have clean Hands, or any part of their Bodies.</p>
               <p>¶ THey <hi>Arabs</hi> that dwell in <hi>Biledulgerid,</hi>

All their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations are purſuing the Oſtrich, and ſeveral ſorts of Hawking, which they much delight in.</p>
               <p>The Grandees pride themſelves in their attendance of <hi>Negroes;</hi> but the Common People having no Servants, domineer over their Wives, exerciſing Supream Authority, putting them not onely to Womens, but Mens Drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; as dreſſing and ſadling their Horſes, and whatſoever buſineſs elſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Houſe or Field.</p>
               <p>There are ſome of theſe <hi>Arabs</hi> that are Students at <hi>Fez,</hi> and ſuch Proficients, that they Commence Doctors, and Profeſſors of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Laws and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; others follow Traffick. But in moſt parts of <hi>Numidia,</hi> many of them are addicted to Poetry; attaining to ſuch a heighth, that they ſet forth in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Verſe long Epick Poems, like <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil,</hi> at large, with high Fancy celebrating the valiant Acts of their former Princes and Conquerors; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they are good at Paſtorals, and ſuch buſineſs of the Field: But in Songs, Sonnets, Madrigals, and the like, which expreſs the various Paſſions of ſad Amours and always dying Lovers, they are moſt exquiſite in beyond belief.</p>
               <p>¶ THeſe <hi>Arabs</hi> are of a mild and ſweet diſpoſition,

               <p>The Merchants adventure more by Land than ours at Sea, putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oft in greater dangers, eſpecially if they ſet forth in Summer; for then uſually ariſe in thoſe Countreys Southern Winds, which raiſe abundance of Sand, that new congealed drifts cover thoſe Pits ſo deep, that all Marks are loſt whereby they may recover them again, ſcarce gueſſing where they were, they often fainting with thirſt periſh there, as may appear by many of their dead Bodies found in the Way by following Travellers. To prevent which miſery in this neceſſitous exigent, no other means being left, they kill their
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:56692:201"/>Camels, and ſqueeze the Water out of their Bowels and Maws; which when they ſet forth, they Tun up in their Bellies in ſuch a quantity as would ſuffice them ten or twelve days: this they refreſh themſelves withall, and oft ſave their lives till they find ſome formerly known Pit: yet in many places Camels Milk may be had.</p>

But if thoſe that obſerve their times to Travel ſet forth upon the advantage of the expected Seaſon, if then it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, as ſometimes it falls out, a general, or ſecond Drought, then not onely Travellers are put to run the riſque, but the Inhabitants loſe the Product of the whole year.</p>
               <p>¶ THere are ſome barren Mountains which bear nothing but inconſiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Shrubs, Briers and Thorns.
<note place="margin">The Vegetables.</note> The moſt fertile Soyl of all <hi>Lybia</hi> Manured, produces onely Barley, and but a few Dates, by which we may judge the ſterility of that Countrey.</p>

               <p>¶ Both Sexes are naturally Libidinous,
<note place="margin">The Diſpoſition of the Inhabitants.</note> delighting much in dalliance and wanton Amours, having no Laws or Cuſtoms prohibiting ſuch Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian courſes, nor ought elſs, following the dictates of their own Nature, and what they are moſt inclinable to.

All their ſtudy, whole endeavour, and buſineſs, beſides a little Hunting, is onely miſchief, either to Rob or Cheat their Companions, and driving their Cattel into the Wilderneſs where they may never be found: which done, they makeit their May-game to laugh and jeer at one another.

               <p>The People of this Countrey, when they Travel, are mounted on Camels, ſitting on a Saddle betwixt the Bunch and Neck, and in ſtead of Spurs uſe a

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:56692:203"/>ſignifying who were there Interr'd, and the cauſe of their lying there, which was thus: One of them a wealthy Merchant, travelling through thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farts, over-power'd by invincible Neceſſity, ſuffering ſtrangely by Thirſt, met by chance with a poor Carrier, who had not yet ſpent all his Water, though under the ſame calamity, with whom he contracted at no leſs Rate than ten thouſand <hi>Ducats,</hi> which he laid down upon the Spot for the Moiety thereof: but ſo it happened that neither of them had any great purchaſe; for the Water being divided was ſoon exhauſted, and proved not ſufficient to ſave either, ſo that languiſhing with extream drought, they both loſt their lives, and were there Interr'd.</p>
                  <p>The Deſart of <hi>Zenega,</hi> inhabited by the People <hi>Zanaga's,</hi> is wondrous hot, and hath little or no Water but what is bitter and brackiſh; and thoſe Pits or Wells are at leaſt twenty miles one from another; But the Wild of <hi>Zenega</hi> is deſtitute of all Water, ſeldom or never raining there, having but one Pit in all the way of thirty miles.</p>
                  <p>This Soyl is all Sandy, and utterly unfruitful, being a vaſt Plain, ſo flat and level, that the Traveller hath no mark to find his way, or know where he is, but is forced to ſteer his Coaſt by the Sun and <hi>Trade</hi>-Winds, which blow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Eaſterly, and other little knowledges they gather by former Prints from the Claws of Fowl, as Crows, Ravens, and ſuch like, which always wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Caravans,</hi> as on great Armies, expecting Prey: for none ever travel through this Deſart but with great Company.</p>
                  <p>This Countrey produces a kind of Grain like Wheat,
<note place="margin">Plants or Vegetables.</note> which grows of its own accord without Sowing; But thoſe near the Banks of the River <hi>Zenega</hi> reap Barley, not wanting Dates; having alſo good ſtore of Camels, Goats, and other Cattel.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of theſe Deſarts are <hi>Breberians, Ludays, Duleyns,</hi> and <hi>Zenega's,</hi> or <hi>Zanaga's,</hi> by <hi>Sanutus</hi> call'd <hi>Azaneghes,</hi> and ſome <hi>Arabs,</hi>

                  <p>There is a ſtrange Beaſt, in Body like a Hog, but Footed like a Badger, that creeps in the Earth like a Mole, and feeds on Ants, or Piſmires, neither yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them profit, nor doing any damage. Here are alſo Hares, Civet-Cats, Dogs, and Apes.</p>
                  <p>The Wilderneſs that borders upon the Kingdoms of <hi>Cayor</hi> and <hi>Borſalo,</hi> breed many wild Beaſts, as Lyons, Tygers, Leopards, Wolves, Elephants and <hi>Alaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi> being Creatures like Crabs, with two Claws, and a Sting in their Tails, like Scorpions, for fear of which the Inhabitants, when they travel through theſe deſolate ways, make great Fires in the night to ſecure their perſons. Nor are the wild Beaſts all that trouble theſe Waſtes, for there are Thieves farther therein, altogether as ſavage and inhumane as thoſe other Beaſts of Prey.</p>
                  <p>The Fowls there far exceed in number the Beaſts, ſuch are <hi>Popinjay's, Parrots, Paraqueeto's,</hi> ſome ſmall, others very large, with Aſh-coloured Necks, and green and yellow Bodies, Geeſe, Ducks, Herons, Partridges, with black and white ſpots; and in Fenny places, Snipes, Wild-Ducks, and many other ſmall Fowl, common with us in <hi>Europe.</hi> Such as we know not, nor have yet ſeen, are the <hi>Akkaviak,</hi> as big as a Turky, with a red tuft of Feathers upon their
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56692:223"/>Crown, which they can raiſe like Briſtles, and ſpread ſo, that they will hang over their Eyes; Hearons white and black, and large as Eagles, but not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they eat nothing but Mans-dung. Pelicans, with Necks ſo great and long as a Mans Arm.</p>
                  <p>Nor is the Land more productive of Beaſts,
<note place="margin">Fiſhes.</note> than the Water is of Fiſh, whereof there is great variety; eſpecially of Carps, Crabs, Pikes, Herrings, and other like; Salmon onely differing in the whiteneſs of their fleſh.</p>
                  <p>In the River <hi>De la Grace,</hi> many Crocodiles breed, which frequently coming on Land, lye basking in the Sun; but upon the ſight or approach of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly (as if afraid) return into the Covert of the Water.</p>
                  <p>When the People which dwell on the Sea-Coaſts are ſtraitned of Proviſion, by the ſcarcity of Harveſt, they ſupply themſelves with Fiſh, going with their <hi>Canoo's,</hi> (wherein three perſons may ſit) out to Sea, without regard of Wind or Weather.</p>
                  <p>¶ LOcuſts abound here in ſuch prodigious numbers,
<note place="margin">Inſects.</note> flying over in <hi>June</hi> out of the North-Eaſt, that they cover the Sky, and darken the Sun, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring all the ripe Plants; ſo that many In-land People ſtarve to death; and others for the preſervation of their lives, ſell themſelves to the <hi>Portugals</hi> for Slaves, as it happen'd in the Year Sixteen hundred forty one.</p>
                  <p>Serpents breed here in too great abundance;
<note place="margin">Serpents.</note> among which the moſt poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous are of a Graſs-green Colour; others frequent the Dwellings of the People, being very harmleſs, and of great uſe in deſtroying Rats and Mice: Theſe the <hi>Negro's</hi> will not permit any to kill, believing that their deceaſed Anceſtors are metamorphoſed into ſuch; and that it is fatal for any to hurt them. When any is bitten with one of the venomous kind, he immediately makes addreſs to a Charmer, who cures them by Inchantment. But if the Witch be abroad, he leaves a piece of Wood at his Door; which upon touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effects the deſire of the party infected. Some will leap up at a man, and twining round about his body, girt him to death; others ſuck the milk out of the Cows Udders; and ſome are ſo prodigiouſly great, that they can ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Buck whole, Horns and all.</p>
                  <p>Here breeds a ſort of Creatures call'd <hi>Leguanes,</hi> which make good Food; as alſo <hi>Efts</hi> or <hi>Lyzards,</hi> which neſting in the Walls, run over people when they ſleep, cauſing Boyls to riſe in the places they touch.</p>
                  <p>Between <hi>Beyhourt,</hi>

                     </note> and the <hi>French Fort,</hi> the whole ground in the bottom of the River <hi>Zenega,</hi> is grown over with Salt, which they break up in great pieces with Irons, and dry it on the Land: thus dried, it grows very white; and which is more, that if all be taken up one day, the next will afford the like quantity; ſo that it is a perpetual Store-houſe of that neceſſary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity; nor are the quantities ſmall, but ſufficient to ſerve the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whereinto 'tis carried upon Camels. The Profit ariſing hereby, the King of <hi>Cayor</hi> hath beſtowed on his Prieſts; who for a Laſt of it, which is a Camels Load, take a <hi>Cape de Verde</hi> Garment, and a Tub full of <hi>Mille.</hi>

                  <p>The Men are of various diſpoſitions, and the Women light and unconſtant, of a craving humor, affecting beſt where they find moſt advantage: when
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56692:223"/>they ſpeak they thruſt forward their Necks, and utter their words in a furious tone: In brief, they are in general by nature very wanton, thieviſh, treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lying, eſteeming it a credit ingeniouſly to betray; unconſtant, beyond meaſure jealous, and ſo voracious Gluttons, that they may be ſaid to devour rather than eat.</p>
                  <p>They have great propenſity to, and skill in Sorcery,
<note place="margin">Their properſity to Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</note> ſo that they can charm Serpents, as we hinted before, whoſe venomous blood they take, and mingling with the Seed of a Tree, empoyſon their Weapons with it, whoſe effect is ſo mortal, that who-ever is wounded therewith dies in half an hour. They believe farther, that they can bewitch any in ſuch manner, as to cauſe them to die of a languiſhing Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Ivala,</hi> call'd <hi>Walla Silla,</hi> as they report, in eight or ten days can bring together, if need require, five thouſand Men, whereof about ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe: a great many, conſidering the whole Countrey doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain above fifty or ſixty miles.</p>

                  <p>¶ THeir greateſt Employment, as to matter of getting a Livelihood,
<note place="margin">Their Maintenance.</note> is Digging, keeping of Cattel, and Fiſhing: ſome few follow Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing, while others buſie themſelves either at the Forge, making Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoes and Arms for the War, or in Weaving: in both which (though their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterpieces) yet are they but mean Workmen.</p>

                  <p>¶ THe Weapons and Arms of the <hi>Jalofs</hi> are Lances, Bowes and Arrows made of Iron-Plates; a kind of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Scimiter, crook'd like a Bowe; round and broad Shields made of very hard Skins; Darts, which they ſhoot in long Bowes made of Canes.</p>
                  <p>Others carry a great Shield made of Oxe-Hides, with a Scimiter and great Knife by their ſide, a long Aſſagay or Javelin, with two other ſhort Darts, by them call'd <hi>Sinchirin;</hi> which by the help of a loop faſtened in the middle of it, wherein they put one finger, they can throw very ſteady, and with great ſwiftneſs and ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>They have a ſort of ſmall Horſes for ſervice, which they know how to ride with great dexterity. The <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Barbary</hi> ſometimes carry their Horſes thither, and ſell them to the <hi>Blacks;</hi> every Horſe for ten, twelve, or thirteen Slaves, each Slave accompted for nine and twenty Bars of Iron. Theſe Horſes, as ſoon as they have them, they charm by a certain peculiar method of Incantation, believing by that means they ſhall paſs ſhot-free in the Wars.</p>
                  <p>Such Horſemen as follow the Wars, mount and diſmount with ſuch active agility as is admirable; for they can in full ſpeed ſtand upright on the Saddle, turn this way and that way, ſtand upon their hands, bow their bodies, lie down on their ſides, and take up any thing from the earth.</p>
                  <p>Their Arms are Scimiters, long Javelins with long Iron-points, wherewith they ſtrike, holding it in their hands without caſting.</p>

                  <p>When the King of <hi>Ale</hi> intends to War upon his Neighbours, he calls a Council, with whom he Treats in a Wood cloſe by the Palace, in which they ſit about a round Hole three Foot deep, with their Heads hanging down. This Hole they cover after the riſing of the Council: for the King ſaith, <hi>That the Hole will never diſcloſe his Secrets,</hi> letting them underſtand thereby, that none ſhall know what their Determination is. By this means, and for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſht as Traitors and betrayers of their Countrey, their Enemies can never learn ought of their Reſolution till it be brought to effect; which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt is the chiefeſt cauſe of their ſucceſs.</p>

                  <p>When any Noble-man comes to the King, he puts off his Shirt, and lays it upon his right Shoulder and Arm, appearing onely in his cloſe Coat, call'd by them <hi>Joula,</hi> and ſo draws near to the King; who is always attended with a great Train of Courtiers and other Servants, who, as a Guard to his Perſon, are Armed with Aſſagay's, and other Weapons of Defence.</p>
                  <p>Every Town on the Coaſt of <hi>Cape Verde</hi> hath an <hi>Algayere,</hi> or <hi>Alkaid,</hi> ſet there by the King of <hi>Cayor,</hi> to receive the Cuſtom of Foreign Ships, that is, three Bars of Irons for each Veſſel; but when they find any Merchants unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in their Modes, they extort as much as they can get; beſides, every Ship pays to the <hi>Alkaid</hi> for their Water ten Bars of Iron, or the like value in other Merchandiſe, and ſometimes a Cask of Brandy-Wine.</p>

                  <p>As to matters of diſtributive Juſtice, or puniſhments of Crimes, they are in a manner ſtrangers to both; the greateſt extravagancies being bought off, and pardoned by paying of Slaves, or ſome other Mulct to the King.</p>
                  <p>¶ THeir Religion,
<note place="margin">Their Religion.</note> if ſo we may call it, is generally <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> for they greet the New-Moon with horrible roarings, and ſtrange geſtures of adoration: they offer their Sacrifices in the Woods before great hollow Trees, wherein they have placed Idols: and this they do rather out of cuſtom then zeal, uſing neither form nor method in their Devotions, nor any particular Aſſemblies, but every one following the dictates of his own humor, makes a God in his own Fancy, which is as often varied as their Luſts or Paſſions raiſes in them other motions: Some of them ſeem to incline to <hi>Mahumetaniſm,</hi>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:56692:225"/>and admit among them ſome <hi>Marabouts;</hi> but ſo little have they prevailed upon them, that they know not what the <hi>Sala</hi> means, nor do the Prieſts any other Service than write <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters on ſmall Papers, which ſew'd in little Leather Purſes, are worn by the <hi>Blacks</hi> on their Necks, Arms, Legs, Heads, and every part of their Bodies in great numbers, firmly believing, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in time to come, they ſhall be freed of all troubles and dangers, to the great gain of the <hi>Marabouts,</hi> who ſell them at no ſmall Prices. And although they know there is a God, yet have they no underſtanding to worſhip him: and uſe Circumciſion the fifth or ſixth Year; and then, if they be asked the reaſon thereof, they can give no other account, but that it is an antient Cuſtom recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among them, but farther know not.</p>
                  <p>None of the Prieſts are permitted to Marry but in their own Families, nor may teach any to Read or Write without the chief <hi>Marabout</hi>'s Licence.</p>
                  <p>They hold the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion in great abomination, affirming, that God who giveth all things, and can do what he pleaſeth, and cauſes Thunder, Lightning, Rain and Wind, is Omnipotent, and needs neither praying to, nor to be ſet forth in ſo myſterious a way as that of the Trinity: and thus <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> generally poſſeſſes the whole Countrey.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Both theſe Princes have ſeveral populous Towns belonging to them, but,
<note place="margin">Several Towns lying on <hi>Gambea.</hi>
                     </note> as we ſaid, all without Walls, and ſcituate on both the Shores of <hi>Gambea,</hi> which
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:56692:226"/>like the <hi>Nyle,</hi> overflowing it Banks, much enriches and fertilitates the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Soyl.</p>
                  <p>The Sea-Coaſt hereabouts ſhooting from the South is very low, and in that regard, unleſs in very clear weather, hard to be known; but more forward the Land riſes high, is full of Trees, and ſpreads North-Eaſt and South-Weſt.</p>
                  <p>At the Mouth of this River ſtands the Town <hi>Barra;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Barra.</note> ſo named, becauſe every Ship that comes thither muſt give a Bar of Iron, which they call <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> to the King of <hi>Borſalo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Above the South-Point ſtands a Town call'd <hi>Nabare,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nabare.</note> within a Wood.</p>
                  <p>Three miles higher on the ſame Point lieth a Town call'd <hi>Bintam,</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Portugals.</hi>

                  <p>Half a mile beyond the Creek, on the South-ſide, lieth the River and Town call'd <hi>Jambay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jambay. Manſibaer. Barraconda.</note> with another named <hi>Manſibaer,</hi> on the North.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place you come to <hi>Barraconda,</hi> above which the Sea floweth not; ſo that whoever will go higher, muſt Row againſt the Stream.</p>
                  <p>After a tedious and toilſom Journey of ten days you arrive at <hi>Tinda;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tinda.</note> above which ſtands <hi>Joliet;</hi>

                  <p>Five and fifty miles within the Land ſtands <hi>Borſalo;</hi> and eighty five miles, <hi>Little Caſſan;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Small Caſſan. Groat Caſſan.</note> three miles above which the vaſt and great City <hi>Caſſan</hi> ſhews it ſelf, whoſe ſide is waſhed by the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, and where the King keeps his Court.</p>
                  <p>¶ AMong other Rivers that water theſe Countreys,
<note place="margin">The River <hi>Gambea.</hi>
                     </note> one of the principal is <hi>Gambea,</hi> or <hi>Gambia,</hi> ſo call'd by the <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> after the example of the <hi>Blacks,</hi> who call all the Tracts of Land, reaching from the Mouth of it to the <hi>Gold-Coaſt Gambu.</hi> Its Mouth is about three miles broad, hath five fathom Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and lies in thirteen Degrees and nineteen Minutes North Latitude, between the <hi>Zenega</hi> and <hi>Rio Grande.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It draws the original from the great River <hi>Niger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Its Original.</note> at the place where it makes a great Lake, and divides in four branches, which are afterwards named <hi>Zenega, Gambea, Sante Domingo,</hi> and the <hi>Great River;</hi> all which after ſeveral long courſes, having viſited and refreſhed theſe hot Countreys with their pleaſant Streams, at laſt near <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> pour forth their Waters into the <hi>Great Ocean;</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Gambea,</hi> with ſo ſtrong a Current, and ſuch abundance of Water, that ſixteen miles in the Sea (as they ſay) that Water may be taken up.</p>
                  <p>They may row up in this River againſt the Stream near a hundred miles; but then are ſtopped with a ſtrong Water-fall, which with an impetuous noiſe pours down over the Rocks, and by that means becomes unpaſſable. The Channel is for the moſt part very broad, eſpecially from the <hi>Gold-Coaſt</hi> of <hi>Cantor</hi> or <hi>Reskate,</hi> to its Mouth; and by the receiving of many other Streams becomes full of water; and gliding alſo eaſier by reaſon of the breadth, to the great eaſe of all Veſſels that go up againſt the Stream.</p>
                  <p>By the Village <hi>Tinga,</hi> the River is fordable, but none dare venture to wade through it, but the <hi>Blacks,</hi> for fear of the Crocodiles; however on both its Shores are many Villages, and within its boſome divers ſmall Iſlands.</p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:56692:226"/>
                  <p>Twelve miles upwards of <hi>Tondebu,</hi> half a mile above the Creek <hi>Jayre</hi> on the left hand, lies a little Iſland, betwixt the which and the main Land, the Stream is no broader than a Muſquet-ſhot, ſhallow, and runs in many Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but higher on the left ſide is four or five fathom deep.</p>
                  <p>About two miles about <hi>Manſibaer,</hi> lies another Iſland, that ſo ſtraightens the paſſage, that without great trouble they cannot go through it.</p>
                  <p>Not far from <hi>Nabare,</hi> half way between the Mouth of the River and the Gold place of <hi>Cantor</hi> or <hi>Reskate,</hi> lieth <hi>Elephant-Iſland,</hi> ſo call'd, for the great number of Elephants which breed there.</p>
                  <p>¶ THe Air in this Countrey is continually hot,
<note place="margin">The Air.</note> though with ſome little variation from the beginning of <hi>June</hi> till the end of <hi>September,</hi> in which time it rains every day at Noon; and at Night from the Eaſt and South-Eaſt, continual Lightnings and Thunder.</p>
                  <p>But the greateſt Rains falls from <hi>May</hi> till the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which cauſes the Rivers to ſwell and overflow their Banks, and that proves a very unhealthful time; for the firſt Rains falling upon the naked people, cauſe blotches and ſpots, and on the Clothes of the <hi>Whites,</hi> it breeds Worms, but after a little time that inconvenience vaniſhes.</p>
                  <p>¶ ALl along the Banks of <hi>Gambea,</hi> and about <hi>Caſsan,
<note place="margin">Vegetables or Plants.</note> Tobacco</hi> grows plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, which the <hi>Portugals</hi> fetch with Sloops both green and dried, without making up in Rolls; Cotton alſo, with Mille, Rice, Lemons, Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Apples, and <hi>Ananaſſes,</hi> but not in ſuch abundance as ſome have written.</p>
                  <p>On the Sea-Coaſt are Trees above ſeventeen Paces in compaſs, and not twenty in height; whereas further into the Countrey, they are tall and ſlender.</p>
                  <p>¶ BEaſts fit for labour and ſervice breeding here, are Camels,
<note place="margin">The Beaſts.</note> ſmall Horſes and Aſſes: But they have beſides many Cows and Oxen, as appears by their Hides yearly brought into <hi>Europe;</hi> as alſo Goats, Sheep, Deer red and fallow, with divers others, beſides the Wilde Beaſts found in the Wilderneſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Lyons, Tygers, Baboons, Otters, Elephants, and the like.</p>
                  <p>This plenty of Cattel makes Proviſion in thoſe places ſo cheap, that about <hi>Gambea</hi> you may buy a Beaſt of three or four hundred weight for a Bar of Iron, although at <hi>Cape de Verde</hi> they pay four or five Bars for the like.</p>
                  <p>¶ THe people heretofore were ſavage and cruel, but ſince they have in ſome ſort by the Converſe of Chriſtian Merchants, received ſome notions of Religion, they are become tractable and courteous.</p>
                  <p>The Kings (as we ſaid) keep a Majeſtick Port, according to their manner of State, ſeldom appearing in publick to their Subjects.</p>
                  <p>They are all great lovers of Brandy, and will drink thereof even to exceſs:
<note place="margin">Their propenſity to Brandy.</note> And if any Forreigner, Merchant, or other, deſires Audience of the King, he can by no means ſooner effect it, than by preſenting him with a Bottel of Brandy.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Great Caſſan</hi> call'd <hi>Magro,</hi> who ſpoke the <hi>Portugal</hi> Tongue,
<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Caſſan</hi> a great Sorcerer.</note> yet could not be won to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> was well skill'd in <hi>Necromantick</hi> Arts, whereof one <hi>Block</hi> in a Journal of his Travels gives a particular account: We will onely inſtance in one or two of his preſtigious actions. He commonly wore as many inchanted Chains without trouble, as would have over-loaden a
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:56692:227"/>ſtrong Man. One time, to ſhew his Art, he cauſed a ſtrong Wind to blow, but confined it onely to deſigned limits, ſo that the next adjoyning places were not ſenſible of any violent motion. Another time deſiring to be reſolved of ſome queſtioned particular, after his Charms a ſmoke and flame aroſe out of the Earth, by which he gathered the anſwer to his demand.</p>
                  <p>¶ MOſt of the Wealth of the Inhabitants conſiſts in Slaves,
<note place="margin">Their Riches.</note> though ſome have Gold; for among them are few Artificers, and thoſe that are, onely Weavers and Smiths,
<note place="margin">Artificers</note> who are ill provided of Tools for their Work, yet make ſhift therewith. The Smiths make ſhort Swords, and knowing how to harden the Iron, form the Heads of their Aſſagay's or Lances, Darts or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and all ſorts of Inſtruments with which they Dig the Earth. Their Bellows are a thick Reed, or hollow piece of Wood, in which is put a Stick wound about with Feathers, which by the moving of the Stick makes the Wind. The Iron which they Forge is brought over out of <hi>Europe</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Bars, in Pieces of eight or ten Inches long, and are exchanged with great gain in barter for their In-land Commodities. The Weavers make Cloathes of Cotton, which by the Merchants are carried to <hi>Serre-Lions, Serbore,</hi> and the <hi>Gold-Coaſt,</hi> and there barter'd for Ivory, red Wood, and Gold. Theſe Cloathes, becauſe made alſo about <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> are call'd <hi>Cape de Verde Cloathes;</hi> being of three ſorts: the beſt and chiefeſt, call'd <hi>Panoſſakes,</hi> are two Ells and a half long, and an Ell and a half broad, whitened upon the Ground, and with Liſts commonly of eight Bands ſew'd together: the ſecond <hi>Bontans,</hi> two Ells long, and an Ell and a half broad, very neatly Strip'd, having ſix Lifts ſew'd together: but the third ſort, named <hi>Berfoel,</hi> are great Cloathes, made with blue Stripes: all which are commonly bought for Iron, that is, one <hi>Panoſſakes</hi> for one Bar of Iron, three <hi>Bontans</hi> for two Bars, and two great <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foel</hi> Cloathes for one Bar.</p>
                  <p>¶ EVery one,
<note place="margin">Their Tillage.</note> be he Spiritual or Temporal, old or young, muſt Till his own Ground, if he intends to eat, the King onely, and ſome chief Nobles, and antient decrepid people excepted: for the doing whereof they uſe no Ploughs, but dig the Earth with a kind of Mattocks in the time of their Rain, becauſe then the Ground is ſoftened.</p>
                  <p>¶ THeir Food is <hi>Mille,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Food.</note> Shell-Fruit, Milk, and ſome Fleſh. They Bake no Bread, but boyl it as we in theſe Countreys do Puddings, which they eat hot. Their Drink is <hi>Palmito</hi>-Wine, and for want of that, Water; but the Prieſts with their whole Families drink no ſort of ſtrong Drink, but only Water.</p>
                  <p>¶ THe Houſes,
<note place="margin">Their Houſes.</note> like thoſe in <hi>Zenega,</hi> are onely round Huts, with Walls of Reed, Lime, and Earth, covered with Canes, and environ'd with a <hi>Palliſado,</hi> or Hedge of Canes.</p>

                  <p>Their Arms are the ſame as we mention'd before in <hi>Zenega: Sanutus</hi> ſays, they are very warlike and ſtout, which they have often manifeſted, when in their little <hi>Almadyes</hi> they adventur'd to board ſome <hi>Portugal Carvils,</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard either to their Canon or other Arms. For though theſe <hi>Blacks</hi> have no hopes of Victory, and many of them are ſlain, yet they regard not their lives, nor ever run away from the Fight.</p>
                  <p>They work alſo their <hi>Almadyes</hi> and <hi>Canoos</hi> with ſuch dexterity, that they force them forward with incredible nimbleneſs, and betake themſelves upon the approach of Ships which they think will damnifie them, to the mouth of ſome ſmall River.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Barbary</hi> come in great numbers, with Camels to Trade at <hi>Yaye</hi> for Gold, whereof that Countrey affords great ſtore, and return home richly laden with it.</p>
                  <p>The manner of dealing between theſe People and the before-mentioned <hi>Arabians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How the Trade is driven by the People of <hi>Taye.</hi>
                     </note> in exchange of their Goods, is this: They of <hi>Barbary</hi> go to an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place, where they lay their Wares in ſeveral heaps, diſtinct one from the other; which done, they go away and return not for a whole day: in the mean times the Natives come, and lay over againſt every heap as much Gold as they value the Parcels at, then go away, leaving on the place both their own Gold and the Merchants Goods; who upon his return finding that he hath his value in Gold, takes it away and leaves his Merchandiſe; but if he expects more, he divides his heaps, and lets them ſo remain; which the People ſeeing, lay more Gold, or if they think not fit to give more, they take that away which they laid there firſt: thus in three times the Bargain is driven and ended. The reaſon why the People will not be ſeen, is the loathſomneſs of their Bodies; for their lower Parts, through the exceſſive ſcorching of the Sun, are always raw and ſore, in ſuch manner, that if it were not for ſprinkling them with Salt, they would rot; and that is the cauſe why they ſo much deſire Salt.</p>
                  <p>¶ <hi>TInda</hi> yields great abundance of Hides, but the trouble, and almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibility of coming up the River with great Veſſels, very much hinder Trade; beſides Iron bears not ſo good a Rate there as in other places, becauſe the Inhabitants ſay, they have Ore thereabouts, of which they can make it: But Salt is a moſt deſirable Commodity, not onely there, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed over all the Countrey. At the firſt diſcovery of theſe Places they carried thither a bad and blackiſh Salt, which went off well enough; but ſince the People have gained skill and knowledge ſo to diſtinguiſh, that they will not deal for it, but onely for the whiteſt; in exchange whereof they give Slaves, Hides, Elephants Teeth, Cotton, Cotton-Yarn, Cotton-Cloathes, and Gold.</p>
                  <p>In the City <hi>Joliet,</hi> lying beyond <hi>Tinda,</hi> there is, as the <hi>Blacks</hi> relate, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gold; and the like at a Place call'd <hi>Munkbar:</hi> whither alſo the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Barbary</hi> come, with Camels laden with Salt, and all ſorts of Merchandiſes, which they barter onely for Gold. But the Inhabitants of the City <hi>Sillico</hi> buy Salt of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> for <hi>Blacks.</hi>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:56692:228"/>their ordinary buſineſs and employments. Beſides themſelves none can, or may learn to Write or Read, and that ignorance nuzzles them up even to the neglect of all acts of Devotion whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Santons,</hi> as other <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> make mention ſometimes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom they call <hi>Nabe,</hi> and ſay he was a great Prophet, who wrought many Miracles, and had a Mother named <hi>Mary;</hi> but particularly deny him to be the Son of God, objecting that God is inviſible, incomprehenſible, and a Spirit, which cannot Beget, neither needs a Son to be with him.</p>
                  <p>When any of them die, he is buried with all his Gold; and he is reputed the happieſt who is buried with the greateſt quantity: ſo that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their pretenſions to zeal both living and dying, Gold is their onely Deity.</p>

                  <p>When the <hi>Blacks</hi> gather this Fruit, they climb up with a Rope about their middle very readily and nimbly, and cut the Nuts from the bunch, whereof they make their Palm-Oyl in this manner; firſt they beat and ſtamp them, then boil it a firſt and ſecond time; at the laſt boiling the Oyl ſwims at top, which they ſcum off with Spoons, and put into Pots or Pitchers: They uſe this Oyl as Butter or Oyl-Olive, which they have not, and anoint their Bodies therewith from head to foot, to make the Skin ſmooth and ſhining.</p>

                  <p>There are two other of a ſmaller ſort, call'd <hi>Cillach Vondoh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cillach.</note> as big as Stags with us in <hi>Europe,</hi> having little Horns a ſpan long, a Skin of the ſame colour, with a Tumour, or rather ſwelling Orifice on both ſides, where the Wind co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out, makes them unable or unfit, either for running or leaping.</p>

<note place="margin">Woey.</note> Gazellus de Mutte,</hi> being as big as an ordinary Dog, ſmall bone'd, and ſwift in running, makes good ſport to Men and Women that Hunt it, uſing many cunning ſhifts to avoid the Nets.</p>

                  <p>There are two ſorts of wild Boars; one reddiſh-hair'd, call'd <hi>Kouja;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Two ſorts of Boars.</note> the other black-hair'd, named <hi>Kouja quinta:</hi> The former like ours, but the later much bigger, and very miſchievous, having monſtrous Tusks, wherewith they cut and tear, as if it were ſplit with a hatchet.</p>

<note place="margin">Two ſorts of Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, or Hedghogs.</note> the bigger by the Natives call'd <hi>Queenja,</hi> reſembles a common Boar, but armed with ſharp and long Quills, which it can dart out ſuddenly with ſo great force, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they kill Leopards with them: The leſs are about a foot high, but not dangerous, in regard they do not diſcharge their Quills.</p>
                  <p>They have alſo <hi>Dontfoes</hi> or Camelions, living (as they ſuppoſe) by the Air,
<note place="margin">Dontfoe.</note> and in nothing harmful, onely they fancy it an ill Omen to ſee one, imagining one of their neareſt friends ſhall die.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſtrange Beaſt call'd <hi>Quoggelo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quoggelo.</note> much reſembling a Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile, ſix or ſeven foot long, very ſlender, but with a Tongue of extraordinary length: It is a Beaſt of Prey, and very ſtrong, cloſe ſet with gawdy Quills over the whole body, wherewith it onely offends men, and defends it ſelf againſt other Creatures; for when the Leopard attempts to ſeize it, it converts into a round ball, ſetting up the points of his Quills, that no hold can be fixed. Their food is generally Piſmires, which with their tongues they lick up at a great diſtance.</p>
                  <p>Both on the Sea-Coaſt and the up-land Countrey many Civet-Cats are found; of whoſe <hi>Genus</hi> there is great difference among Authors:
<note place="margin">Civet-Cat.</note> Some will reduce them under the kind of Cats, according to their name; but <hi>Johnſton</hi> ranks it with the <hi>Hyena;</hi> we will briefly deſcribe it, and ſo leave the Reader to his own judgement: It more reſembles a Wolf than a Cat; for it hath a long Head, with a ſmall Noſe, flat Mouth, and ſhort Ears, their Teeth like thoſe of a Dogs; the body part white, part aſh-colour'd, ſpeckled with black ſpots, the legs and feet of a middle ſize, with black hairs, having four Claws forward, and one backward, with black ſhort flat nails; the Tail long, buſhy and ſpeckled, hanging to the ground.</p>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:56692:245"/>
                  <p>From what part the Civet is gathered,
<note place="margin">In what part the Civet is gotten.</note> there have been many different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The famous <hi>French</hi> Phyſitian <hi>Riolanus</hi> holds it to be the Dung, or Ordure; but <hi>Ruellius</hi> and <hi>Audreas Matthiolus</hi> more truly averre, that it is taken out of the Privities, and that the Cods were the Purſe wherein it was bred; others main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it to be the Sweat, or <hi>Sudor,</hi> about thoſe parts, cauſed by violent motion and beating: but all theſe opinions vary from the truth; for the part wherein this odoriferous Perfume is found, is diſtinct and peculiar, lying between the Privities and the Cods, and ſeems at the firſt glimpſe to be the Matrix: for it hath a long opening, and felt with the Hand, ſeems of the bigneſs of a ſmall Egge, and griſly; which being opened with the Finger, two paſſages appear like Noſtrils; under which are ſome ſmall Cavities as big as Almonds, the place of the Civet, which is taken out thence with a Spoon, or other fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.</p>
                  <p>But beyond all theſe is that monſtrous Creature,
<note place="margin">Quoias-Morrou.</note> which the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Quoias-Morrou,</hi> or <hi>Worrou;</hi> and the <hi>Portugals, Salvage,</hi> that is, <hi>A Satyr:</hi> It hath a great Head, a heavy Body, fleſhy Arms, and ſtrong, no Tail, and goes ſometimes upright, and ſometimes like an Ape on all four. The <hi>Blacks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it to be of humane Extract; but by the alteration and change of the Woods and the Wilderneſs, it is become half a Beaſt. They ſuſtain themſelves in the Woods with Fruit and wild Honey, which they get out of the Trees: and as they are not few, ſo when they meet, continually fight one with the other. The <hi>Blacks</hi> relate ſtrange things of them, and averre it for an infallible truth, that it not onely over-powers feeble Women, and unmarried Maids, but alſo dares ſet upon Armed Men.</p>
                  <p>The Woods produce alſo other wild Beaſts,
<note place="margin">Tygers and Leopards.</note> as Tygers and Leopards; the firſt they call <hi>Quelliqua,</hi> the latter <hi>Quelly.</hi> Theſe two bear great enmity to each other; though the Tyger is generally maſter: wherefore the Leopard, when the Tyger purſues him, with his Tail will wipe out his foot-ſteps, that ſo by them he may not be traced. Some of the Antients, knowing the fierceneſs of the Tyger, attributed to him the command of the Woods: but here, in regard he hurts no Man, but onely Beaſts, they make the Leopard the King of the Woods,
<note place="margin">What Cuſtoms are uſed upon the taking of a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard.</note> becauſe he is more dangerous. For this ravening they are hunted and kill'd by all that can, even for their own ſafety: yet when a Leopard is kill'd, they bring him dead unto the King's Town, there to be cut up and eaten; but if the Reſiants there be not acquainted with it before-hand, they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it without great oppoſition; and therefore, with Weapons in their hands, every man falls upon the bringers of the Leopard, who come alſo Armed to abide the expected brunt: Thus meeting, they fight eagerly, till one ſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abſolute Victors: which for the moſt part are the King's Men, to whom the Leopard is left as a booty; which they commonly draw into the Town, &amp; with extraordinary mirth convey to the place where they uſe to exhibit their Sports: where being flea'd, his Skin and Teeth they preſent to the King: but the People aſſembled eat the Fleſh boyl'd as a great Dainty; ſpending the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the day in Revelling and Dancing, as at their moſt ſolemn Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals. But the King forbears to eat it, becauſe it is, as we ſaid, accounted the King of the Woods. But if this eſteemed Royal Beaſt be taken by any, that that have neither ſtrength nor confidence to make ſuch a Bravado, they ſeek out among them ſome more than uſually bold Fellows, who for ſome inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hire will take upon them to bring the Leopard cunningly into the King's Town. Theſe, by the help of one or two Comrades, drag the Leopard thither
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:56692:245"/>unſeen, and lays it near the Sporting-place; then withdrawing into the Houſe of his acquaintance, waiting till ſome find it; who upon the firſt ſight with great eagerneſs cries out: then aſſembling the People he tells them, <hi>There is yet another King brought in without our knowledge.</hi> Upon this all the People run out of their Houſes, and the bringers diſcovering themſelves, every one gives them the hand of friendſhip, and according to their faſhion, indigitate the Perſon to all their Friends with theſe words, <hi>You are the Man to whom we may truſt in need; we have ſeen your works,</hi> and ſo proceed to flea and eat it, as before.</p>
                  <p>The King ſells the Leopards Skin, if he be not minded to ſit upon it, nor to lay it upon the earth to tread on; but the Teeth (which are highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) he beſtows upon his Wives, who wear them in ſtead of Jewels both about their Necks, and upon their Clothes.</p>
                  <p>Inſects breed there innumerably, as Serpents call'd <hi>Tombe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inſects.</note> above two foot long, and as thick as an ordinary mans leg, with curious ſpeckled Skins; they have no innate antipathy to man, whom they never offend till hurt or trod on; yet ſuch is their venome, that whoſoever they bite dies irrecoverably within two or three hours.</p>
                  <p>The Serpent <hi>Minia</hi> attains ſuch largeneſs,
<note place="margin">The Serpent <hi>Minia.</hi>
                     </note> that it can kill and ſwallow a whole Deer without chewing or tearing to pieces, and devours Boars and many other ſuch like Beaſts and Cattel: It lurks for Prey in ſome buſh, which coming within reach, it ſuddenly ſeizes, winding two or three times about the body, and twiſts it ſelf about the loins, till it falls down and dies; of which thus glutted, he lies not able to ſtir, till his gorged Paunch ha's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted his meal. The Piſmires have ſuch a natural enmity to him, that if they find him thus infeebled with his over-feeding, they creep into his body, and kill him. The fleſh of this Creature the <hi>Blacks</hi> account good Food.</p>
                  <p>¶ NOr are Beaſts, Inſects, and Reptiles onely found here, but Fowls alſo of divers kinds; particularly <hi>Qualontia,</hi> being of a large ſize,
<note place="margin">Eagle.</note> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, remaining moſt in the Woods, and feeding upon the fleſh of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet-Cats, and other Beaſts, and rooſting commonly in the high Tree call'd <hi>Banda.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">Baſtard-Eagle.</note> keeps moſt at the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſide, preying on Fiſh, which ſwimming near the ſurface of the water, he takes in an inſtant.</p>
                  <p>The Buzzard or Kite call'd <hi>Simby,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Kite.</note> feaſts it ſelf with the fleſh of all other ſmaller Birds.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Poi</hi> alſo a Bird of Prey,
<note place="margin">Poi.</note> and accordingly arm'd with crooked Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, frequents the Sea-ſhore, and feeds upon Crabs, which with great cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and diligence it catches.</p>
                  <p>Blue Parrots with red Tails are numerous, rooſting on the Palmeto-Trees,
<note place="margin">Parrots.</note> and eating the Nuts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Comma</hi> hath great variety of fine Feathers, green about the Neck,
<note place="margin">Comma.</note> red Wings, black Tails, crooked Bills, and Claws like a Parrot.</p>
                  <p>There is a Bird in bigneſs like a Thruſh, with black feathers,
<note place="margin">Prognoſticating Birds call'd <hi>Clofyf.</hi>
                     </note> by them call'd <hi>Clofyf,</hi> who (as they ſay) by the difference of his chattering, prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates either good or bad luck; inſomuch, that when any travel through the Woods, if they hear this Bird cry about them, <hi>Kybo fy offygh,</hi> they take that for an ill Omen, and will by no means go any farther that day. On the contrary, if their Journey ſhall be proſperous, and this Bird cries in another
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:56692:246"/>manner, which they expound, <hi>Forward, go on,</hi> in the <hi>Folgiaske Tongue,</hi> they no longer deſpair, but proceed forward in their Journey ſo ſoon as poſſible. They repute him an ominous and unlucky Bird, and ſay, that the <hi>Kigbofy</hi> hath ſung his Song over all thoſe that die an evil death. He keeps moſt in places where Piſmires frequent, which are his principal food.</p>
                  <p>There is another little Bird like a Lark,
<note place="margin">Fonton.</note> call'd <hi>Fonton,</hi> who having found in the Woods a Buffel or Elephant, or Honey in a Tree, or a Tyger, or Snake, or any thing elſe whether good or bad, immediately flies towards the people, fluttering about them, and making a noiſe with his wings; whereupon they follow him, ſaying, <hi>Tonton kerre, Tonton kerre,</hi> that is, <hi>We come.</hi> Then he flies forward chirroping, till come to the thing he would ſhow. But if they do not follow him, nor regard his noiſe, he never reſts flying backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, till perceiving the unmindful Travellers approach near what he would diſcover, he perches upon a tree; by which ſudden ſettling, they know they are not far from ſomething he would ſhew to them.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo Swallows,
<note place="margin">Swallows.</note> which they call <hi>Lele</hi> or <hi>Lele-atterecna,</hi> that is, Day-Swallows, to diſtinguiſh them from Bats, which they call <hi>Lele-Sirena,</hi> that is, Night-Swallows. The <hi>Blacks</hi> report that they have another ſort of Swallows, which they ſtile <hi>Tonga,</hi> of the bigneſs of Pigeons, but without any reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the other. Their Fleſh proves good meat, of which there is no ſcarcity; being ſo numerous, that ſometimes ſitting upon trees in flocks, their great weight tears down whole branches as big as a mans leg.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another Bird like a Wood-pecker,
<note place="margin">The Fowl which picks the Trees hollow.</note> who with his Bill makes a concave hole in trees, and in that hollow breeds the young; of which the <hi>Blacks</hi> relate this following ſtory.</p>
                  <p>This Bird (they ſay) complained in antient times to <hi>Kanou,</hi> that the people ſtole away his Young where ever he made his Neſt, deſiring <hi>Kanou,</hi> that for the future he would ſmother them when they committed ſuch theft. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Kanou</hi> ſeem'd by promiſe to conſent; but enjoyn'd, that in regard the huge trees would hinder the fall of the Heavens, he firſt cut them down, and then by weight of their fall upon the earth, he would certainly ſmother the people.</p>
                  <p>There are many Turtle-Doves,
<note place="margin">Turtle-Doves and Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> which they call <hi>Papoo,</hi> and three ſorts of Partridges or Pheaſants with ſpeckled feathers. The firſt call'd <hi>Bollend,</hi> hath a tuft on his head; the ſecond, <hi>Kambyge,</hi> bald and without feathers; the third, <hi>Decedeu,</hi> hath black feathers mixt with ſmall white ſpecks, and a white neck.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cufonfoo</hi> is a Bird as big as a Raven,
<note place="margin">Cufonfoo.</note> with black feathers, and a very long and broad Bill, making the Neſt of earth in the Trees; when the Hen ſits, ſhe pulls off all her feathers to lay the young ones in, and remains ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting without any going off, being daily fed by the Cock that flies abroad for food.</p>
                  <p>There are many <hi>Tigua</hi> or Cranes,
<note place="margin">Cranes.</note> which the Inhabitants of <hi>Cape de Verde</hi> call <hi>Aqua-piaffo.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Meſcito's</hi> are here in ſuch abundance, and ſo plague the People, that it is impoſſible almoſt to ſleep, or take any reſt for them.</p>
                  <p>In the time when it rains, which is about <hi>May, June, July, Auguſt,</hi>

This commonly ſprouts on the third day; but then muſt be carefully lookt after, to keep it from Birds, which flock thither in great numbers: but after it hath taken firm Root they mind it no farther, nor have more trouble till grown ripe, and fit for gathering.

<note place="margin">Hunting is free.</note> yet all ſorts of Hunting is uſed not by all: for the Hunting of Elephants and Buffles is dangerous, and undertaken by ſuch onely as will venture their lives; for few eſcape miſchief or death at one time or other.</p>
                  <p>The King hath for his proportion,
<note place="margin">The Revenue of the King.</note> of Elephants and Buffles, one out of two; of Boars, Harts, and other wild Beaſts, a third part; but Water-Elephants, and Sea-Cows, belong wholly to the King, who beſtows upon the taker a Preſent of Rice and <hi>Mille;</hi> but yet leſs than a tenth part. All people are bound to offer the beſt of the Fruits and Plants to <hi>Belly</hi> their Idol for <hi>Junanen,</hi> that is, for the health of the Souls of their deceaſed Friends and Parents.</p>
                  <p>¶ THe Houſes,
<note place="margin">Houſes and Villages.</note> or rather Huts, are round; ſo likewiſe the Villages, and incloſed with Trees, ſtanding cloſe together; and with their Boughs Plaſhed and interwoven, make a good Defence, or Bulwark; the Gates are low, and ſo narrow, that but one man can go through at a time; the whole Incloſure ſhadowed with <hi>Bangoela,</hi> that is, Branches of Vine-Trees, or <hi>Tomboe,</hi> bound together ſo cloſe, that they are forc'd to make certain Holes therein to Shoot through, which they can open and ſhut at pleaſure. At every of the Gates there is a Hut, or moveable Turret, fifteen or ſixteen Foot high; which they can carry in time of need, and ſet in any fit place, made as the Walls, wherein always ſome exquiſite Archers keep Guard, and are as Sentinels, both for diſcovery of the Enemies approach, and to defend againſt their aſſaults.</p>
                  <p>In the middle of the Town lies an open Green to play in; croſs ways leading to the Gates, are Streets, between whoſe ends and the Tree-Wall, round about, is a paſſage to go from place to place. The Towns thus fenced with Trees, they call <hi>Sanſiah;</hi> but other unfenced, <hi>Fonferah,</hi> that is, an open place: ſo that properly we may term the former Cities, and the later Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Hamlets.</p>
                  <p>Into theſe Fortifications the Countrey people alſo without reſtraint repair in time of need, to ſecure their lives, and what they have from depraedations, and alſo by their Perſons and Valour to defend their Abodes.</p>
                  <p>By vertue of an antient Law made by the Tribe of the <hi>Karous,</hi>

                  <p>The people in general are very libidinous,
<note place="margin">The Luſtfulneſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</note> but their ability anſwers not their deſire; however ſuch their too frequent actions, and dealing with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Women, draws upon them no ſmall inconveniences: Nor do the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fall ſhort of the men in their Unchaſtity, wholly giving themſelves up to Venerial Exerciſes; and as if continually troubled with a <hi>Furor Uterinus,</hi> at all times chaw and eat ſuch Herbs and Barks of Trees, as are the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to heighten their deſires to almoſt hourly Congreſſes.</p>

                  <p>¶ BIgamy and Polygamy are accounted Vertues,
<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> every Man keeping as many Wives as he can maintain.</p>
                  <p>The Parents uſed formerly to procure Wives for their Sons; but finding the Women they get were not regarded, now they let them chuſe for themſelves, according to their own pleaſures. However, before the Marriage, the Bride, according to cuſtom, muſt be purchaſed with Preſents and Slaves. Such whoſe ſmall Stocks cannot reach to that, get their Wives by obſequiouſneſs and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that is, they build Houſes, draw Wine, work in their Rice-Fields, and do all other things wherein they may be uſeful; which ſometimes endures three or four years before they can attain their deſire.</p>
                  <p>If any take a liking to a Woman brought by the Merchants from a foreign Countrey, with a purpoſe to Marry her, he makes known his Suit by Preſents after their manner: And the like, as we ſaid, if any man caſt his affection upon a Maid, who is not reſerved for ſome other Perſon; but if ſhe be ſet apart by agreement or promiſe, they admit no hearing to any other: but the intended Bridgroom invites the Maid in the Evening to come to his Houſe, to eat and drink; which, if ſhe ſtands upon her honour, ſhe takes no notice of three or four times; but at laſt goes with her Friends, and after that the ſolemnity is concluded, the Bride remains ſometimes ten or twelve days before ſhe ask for her Bride-Preſents, if they live both in one Village; but if the Maid come from the Countrey, and her acquaintaince which have brought her thither, would go away, then ſhe asks for them before their departure. And theſe muſt always be paid at three diſtinct times, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt ſhe demands her <hi>Cola,</hi> or <hi>Togloe,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>Give me ſomewhat that is next to hand,</hi> whether Beads, or other Ornaments; the ſecond time ſhe requires her <hi>Jaſing,</hi> that is, ſome Goods which the <hi>Whites</hi> bring thither, as Cloth, Garments, or the like; the third time ſhe asks her <hi>Leſing,</hi> that is, a Baſon, Kettle, and Cheſt that ſhe may keep her <hi>Cola</hi> and <hi>Jaſing</hi> in, and a Slave that may wait upon her, and look to her Goods: then, when ſhe hath received all her Dowry, ſhe goes with them to her Friends, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns from whence ſhe came.</p>
                  <p>If now this Woman grow with Child, and it happen upon her Delivery to be a Boy, the Father, ſo ſoon as it can go, fetches it away; but if it be a Girl, it remains with the Mother.</p>
                  <p>If the Man be pleaſed with the Woman that he hath thus had knowledge of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56692:248"/>then he ſends by his people Preſents to her Parents for their Good-will; who ask their Daughter of her intentions: if ſhe deſires her Parents to receive them, that makes up the Match; if not, they ſend them back again. After the Marriage thus perfected in this manner, yet the Man muſt gratifie the Parents, and Maids Companions with ſome Gifts; which ſometimes they retaliate: But to take many Preſents from the Womans Parents, turns greatly to his prejudice: for if it happen that the Wife had rather have another Man, or that the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band will turn her to her Parents, thenceforth all the Preſents given to him are demanded back, but what-ever he hath beſtowed on her or them, they keep; for he muſt do no injury to the Woman, nor to her Parents: But if the Wife will be reconciled, ſhe may; for it is at her choiſe, becauſe the Parents may not force or compel her. But if he have not accepted any of their Gifts, then ſuch a Daughter, if her Husband will, whether ſhe like it or no, muſt continue with him, and yet ſhall have no other eſteem, than according to the Riches ſhe brings him.</p>
                  <p>We have ſaid before, that the Men may have as many Wives as they can maintain; but the firſt Wife that the Man hath Married is the chiefeſt, and call'd by the other <hi>Makilmah,</hi> that is as much as to ſay, <hi>The Governeſs of the Women:</hi> but they are all ſubjected under the authority of the Husband.</p>
                  <p>When any that is of Noble Extract will ſend his Daughter to her Husband, after the Marriage-Preſents are compleated, he gives to accompany her in the way, ſome of his Subjects and Slaves, with two Coats, or Shirts, a Quiver full of Arrows, and a Simiter with a Belt, for a Preſent for her Husband, and three or four <hi>Kanaſters,</hi> or Bags with Rice, and other ſmall trifles.</p>
                  <p>¶ THe giving of Names to their Boyes,
<note place="margin">The accuſtomed Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at the naming of their Children.</note> is done with a particular Ceremony, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Childe is eight or ten dayes old, on a ſet Day, early in the morning, the Perſon deſign'd to give the Name, with a great company carrying Bowes and Arrows, comes leaping and ſhouting with great hurliburly and noiſe; which others in the Town hearing, go out alſo with Bowes and Arrows, Aſſagays or Javelins, and Shields: the company thus aſſembled, they lay about them, as if fighting with their Enemies. After half an hours playing in that manner, the Name-giver taking the Child from the Mother, layeth it down upon a Shield in the midſt of the Concourſe, and puts a little Bowe, made for that purpoſe, into its hand; then he makes a Speech above half an hour long over the Child, admoniſhing it to be as he is, and to follow his example, to be diligent in Tillage and Husbandry, that he may get much Rice, that he may give to every one to eat that ask it, and thereby to get a praiſe-worthy Name; not to covet after another Man's Wife, nor to deceive, or cheat, or be treacherous, whereby a Man, ſays he, ſhall come to ſcorn and contempt. This ſolemnity being ended, he brings the Child to the Mother again: afterwards they muſt go a Hunting, while others provide Wine: after Noon they return home with the Beaſt they have caught, of which, boil'd with Rice, they make a Feaſt; and ſo, with the Women make themſelves merry, and frolick the greateſt part of the Night.</p>
                  <p>But the ſolemnity at naming a Daughter is not ſo great; for a Woman, with ſome few attendants, fetch the Child out of the Mothers Houſe, and lay it upon a Mat, amongſt the reſt, putting a Stick in its Hand, admoniſhing it to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and induſtrious, to waſh it ſelf clean, for that cleanneſs is an ornament to a Woman; to be chaſte and modeſt, not to ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:56692:249"/>ſhe caſt away her own happineſs; to be ready to make and cook Dainties, that her Husband may take a good liking to her; and to aſſociate conſtantly with him at all times: ſo re-delivering it to the Mother, the Ceremony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes.</p>
                  <p>The Women keep from the Men as long as the Children cannot go, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly till it attain the age of a year and a half; for they believe, unleſs the Child Suck ſo long, it would be infected with ſome remarkable Infirmity.</p>

                  <p>The chiefeſt of the Friends at the beginning of the Mourning make a Vow of Abſtinence, ſwearing by a holy Token, which they call <hi>Bolly-Gowe,</hi> with lifting up of hands, that they will keep it; for a common Perſon eight or ten days, and for a Lord, a moneth, or longer; in which time they may not eat any Rice, nor drink out of any whole Veſſel or Cup, but onely out of a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheard, or a little hole made in the ground; neither do the Men ſleep with their Wives, nor may wear any Painted or Colour'd Clothes, but onely Black or White, cut with flaſhes, ſhaving their Hair, and ſleep upon the bare ground.</p>
                  <p>When the time is expired, they come to the <hi>Bolly-Gowe,</hi> and diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with up-lifted Hands from the aforeſaid Promiſe and Vow, with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that they have kept the ſame. Laſtly, a Funeral-Banquet is prepared; for which the Women boyl Rice, and the Men go into the Woods a Hunting, and bring home what they catch, which they boyl and eat, and ſo the whole Ceremony concludes.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that have faſted are gratifi'd with Preſents, every one according to his quality; that is, common perſons, one with a Baſon, another with a little <hi>Garment,</hi> or Salt-Basket, or a piece of Iron or Mat; but perſons of account, with a Staff; Iron, or other Goods, which with them are highly eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>If the acquaintance of the Deceaſed have any ſuſpicion that he died not a natural Death, they neither waſh the Dead, nor lament, till the doubt be reſolved; for they ſay, if any ſhould mourn before, it would be impoſſible to bring to light the guilty perſon, becauſe the Spirit of Envy over-hearing it, would not give any intimation of it.</p>
                  <p>The Enquiry is performed in thismanner: They take the Corps, or in ſtead of that, a piece of his Cloathes, with pairings of his Nails, and ſome of his Hair, ſewing it up like a Pudding, mixed with ſcrapings of <hi>Bondu,</hi> or red Dying-wood: this Roll they put into a <hi>Mortar,</hi> where they ſtamp it. Then two eloquent Men are elected, who ſtand with two Iron Bills or Halberds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Staff-bearers, and claſhing their Bills, ask the Dead what he died of; and whether God took him away or no: if yea, then the Staff-bearers nod, as if they were half aſleep; but if not, they ſhiver and ſhake. In like manner
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56692:250"/>they do upon the other Queſtion of <hi>Who did it? Where is he?</hi> and, <hi>In what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was it done?</hi> At length they receive anſwer, that he died a violent Death, being kill'd by ſome <hi>Bolly;</hi> for <hi>Bolly</hi> is with them all manner of Medicinal Herbs, but the Herb that is venomous or poyſonous, is call'd <hi>Sovach.</hi> But if <hi>Bolly</hi> hath kill'd him, then the Names of moſt Phyſical Herbs are recited, till they have found which of them was uſed; concluding however at laſt, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vach</hi> hath kill'd him. Then is asked whether he was kill'd by a Man or a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and at laſt is asked concerning the place of his dwelling, and perſon. The guilty perſon being found, immediately they are chained to a great Block, and asked if he or ſhe will acknowledge the Fact. If they can be brought to no acknowledgment, then is given to them <hi>Quony;</hi> or elſe, upon acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fact, are cruelly put to death.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Quony</hi> is a Rind, or Bark of a Tree ſo call'd, which in the preſence of Friends, by the ſuſpected perſon, is pull'd off, that the Sap or Juice may be uſed without any deceit. The outermoſt ſcurf of the Bark they pare off, and beat in a Mortar with Water, which after the ſetling affords a very tart Juice; of which they give to thoſe that are taken, three or four <hi>Kalabaſjes,</hi> or Quarts, to drink in the Morning, and not at any other time. In the mean time they conjure and perſwade themſelves, that if the Captive be guilty of the Crime, he will die, or elſe not: At laſt, vomiting the <hi>Quony,</hi> he is held to be quit; but if he cannot do that, though at firſt he brings up a little Froth, he dies; and the Body is either burnt, or elſe caſt into the River.</p>
                  <p>But if it happen that they cannot receive any anſwer, or but ſuch as is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and Amphibological, reſting thereon, though with much diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they forthwith, without farther enquiry, interre the Corps: Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, they go to a <hi>Jakehmo,</hi> or Soothſayer; a vagrant ſort of People, who have no certain Dwelling-place, but rove up and down; and before they anſwer any queſtion, run about diſtractedly, one with a certain kind of Pots, or Cups; another ſounding a Horn; the reſt with Tabers, or little Drums, making a great noiſe and hurliburly, ſeeking, and calling for the <hi>Sovahmo;</hi> from whom, when they have received any information concerning the guilty perſon, then they proceed to the trial with the <hi>Quony,</hi> in the manner aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>¶ IN Right of Inheritance, or poſſeſſing of Goods, this method is obſerved:
<note place="margin">The Inheritance.</note> When the Man dies, and leaves behind him ſome Children that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Age, the elder Brother takes the poſſeſſion of all the Slaves, Wives, Children, moveable and not moveable Goods of his Father, except his own Mother. Thus taking upon himſelf the government of the Family, after time of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed, he draws to the place of Exerciſes before the King, in preſence of all his acquaintance, with his Father's Bowe in his hand, and his Quiver of Arrows at his back, one end of the Bowe he ſets upon the Ground, holding the other end in his hand; in that poſture he declareth openly, that reſolving to be valiant, and to follow his Father's courſe, he will now give a proof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Spectators. After he hath ſhewed his skill and activity, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf before the King in the ſame poſture as before, ſaying, <hi>He is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bear the burthen of his Family, to give the Children under Age an Example, to Till the Ground, to defend the Right of his Family, and what elſe befits him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Deceaſe of this Son, the next eldeſt Brother takes all. But if the eldeſt Son live, and have Children, then his younger Brothers and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have onely ſo much of the Eſtate, as ſhall keep them till they come to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:56692:251"/>Manhood, and maintain the Slaves or Slaveſſes given him in his Father's life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time: for it is the cuſtom in that Countrey, that people of ability beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Children, as well Sons as Daughters, from their Infancy ſome Slaves.</p>
                  <p>But if the Father dies, leaving onely Daughters, either his Father's Brother, if living, or elſe his Father's Brother's Son, that the Name may not be extinct, ſhall inherit.</p>
                  <p>But if there be no Male-iſſue of the Father's ſide, the King is Heir, and takes as well Slaves as Goods and Women to him, allowing a ſufficient mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to ſome truſty Perſon for the bringing up of the Children.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Their Strength and Power.</note> is at preſent ſupported more by Wiſdom and Policy, than by Power; becauſe the ſubjected Countreys of <hi>Cilm, Bolm,</hi> and <hi>Bolmberre,</hi> are accounted more powerful than it. This the Parable of King <hi>Flamboers</hi> Brother, nam'd <hi>Cia-Haddo,</hi> ſeem'd to hint to <hi>Flamboere's</hi> eldeſt Son, threatning <hi>Maſſakoey,</hi> Lord of <hi>Bolm,</hi> to take his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. <hi>There was</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>in antient time a Fowl, with a very fine red Head and Neck, but beyond that, thin of Feathers, and a ſmall Train; but for his beautiful out-ſide appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, was by other Birds choſen King: This Bird ſenſible of his own defects, kept in a Bottel; and when the Council of Fowls was aſſembled, put the Head and Neck onely out; till at length by courſe of time, the great Sacrifice was to be made to the Idol</hi> Belli <hi>in the Wood, which none but the King in Perſon might perform; at which time compell'd to diſſert his Bottle, his poverty and wants were diſcover'd to his great damage.</hi> Thus far <hi>Cia-Haddo.</hi> And without doubt he diſcover'd a great Prudence in that witty Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegm; for to prevent diſcovery, it is not permitted to the People lying Northwards, to paſs through the Eaſterly Countreys; nor for thoſe of the Eaſt, to go with their Ambaſſadors or Merchants through the Weſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: and this (as we ſaid) that they ſhould not diſcover the Secrets, and Conveniences or Inconveniences of the State; therefore they of <hi>Quoia</hi> keep them at diſtance, and traffick for Eaſtern Wares at reaſonable Rates, which they vent to the Weſt, in Exchange for ſuch as are fit for Barter; and Exchange with <hi>European</hi> Merchants, for ſuch Commodities as yield ready Truck with thoſe of the Eaſt.</p>

                  <p>¶ WE will next proceed to their Government;
<note place="margin">The Government.</note> and firſt begin with <hi>Quoia-Bercoma,</hi> at preſent Commanded by a King, with the Title of <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagh,</hi> his Name <hi>Flamboere</hi> the Fourth, Grandſon of one <hi>Bokwalla,</hi> formerly Prince of the <hi>Karou's,</hi> who by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Folgians</hi> conquering the <hi>Veyes</hi> after a tedious War, laid here the Foundations of a Potent Monarchy to his Succeſſors; invited thereto by the fertility of the Soil, and an innate ambition and thirſt of Soveraignty. This acquired Grandeur hath been ſupported with ſuch Policy, that the Inhabitants at all publick Meetings and Solemnities to this day Sing, <hi>He deſcended from above.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This King, like his Anceſtors, holds in ſubjection <hi>Folgia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Quoia</hi> holds ſubject the <hi>Folgia's.</hi>
                     </note> the Region of <hi>Cape de Monte,</hi> and the adjacent places formerly belonging to the people <hi>Vey</hi> and <hi>Puy;</hi> whereupon the Heir of the Crown, when the King dies, requires Earth from the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Folgia</hi> in token of Acknowledgement, and Inſtalls the Lord of <hi>Bolmberre</hi> with the Title of <hi>Dondagh,</hi> by a particular Ceremony; of which we ſhall give this brief Account.</p>
                  <p>The Heir is laid flat upon the ground, with his Face downward, and ſome Earth thrown upon him: Lying thus, they ask what Name he deſireth to have; and what he chuſes, they impoſe together with the Title of <hi>Dondagh.</hi> Then they cauſe him to riſe, and put a Bowe into his hand, and a Quiver of Arrows, to defend the Countrey with; which performed, he diſtributes Slaves, Clothes, Kettles, Baſons and ſuch like Preſents to the King of <hi>Quoia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Power of the preſent <hi>Quoian</hi>-Prince is abſolute and unlimited; ſo that he is the onely and ſole Judge of all Cauſes: For although he admit his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors ſometimes to give their Opinions, yet they ſignifie nothing, for he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his own ſingle reſolved Determinations.</p>
                  <p>This abſolute Power makes him jealous of his Honor: For, he will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it ſhould be diminiſhed by any. His higheſt Pomp conſiſts in ſitting upon a Shield, whereby he gives to underſtand, that he is the Protection and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Countrey, and the manager of all Wars, pacifying Civil Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and other Weighty Matters belonging to him alone. His Title as we ſaid is <hi>Dondagh,</hi> which is as much as <hi>Monarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When any Nobleman proves diſobedient and will not appear before him on Summons, then he ſends his <hi>Koredo,</hi> that is, his Shield,
<note place="margin">In what manner the King deals with any man who keeps away from his duty.</note> as if he would ſay upbraidingly, if you be not obedient, be Lord your ſelf, and bear the burden of the Countrey. This peremptory Command by the Shield is ſent by two Drummers, who as ſoon as they come near the Offenders Habitation, begin to beat their Drums, and ſo continue without ceaſing, till they have delivered the Shield; upon receipt whereof, without delay, he muſt ſpeed away to the Court, carrying the Shield with him, which he preſents to the King, begging forgiveneſs of his miſcarriages; and ſo taking up Earth before the King, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himſelf.</p>
                  <p>¶ THoſe that make an Addreſs to the King to obtain his Favor,
<note place="margin">An addreſs to the King to obtain his favor, now it is made.</note> make their way with Preſents of Ribbons, Elephants-Teeth, or ſuch things which he muſt deliver at the houſe of the Kings chiefeſt Wife; who receiving
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:56692:253"/>the ſame bears it to the King, with requeſt, that the perſon may be admitted to his Preſence: If the King accept it, the perſon hath leave to enter, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if any complaints be brought againſt him, he ſends it back, yet ſo, as the Preſenter dares not receive and carry it away, but continues his Suit by Friends without intermiſſion; by whoſe frequent and renewed mediations, the King at laſt ſeeming a little pacified, remits his ſeverity, takes the Preſent, and calls for the Suppliant; who entring the Royal Preſence, goes bowing all along towards the King, who ſits on the ground upon a Matt, leaning upon a Stoole: when he approaches within two ſteps, he bows himſelf to the Earth, kneeling down upon one Knee with his right Elbow to the Earth, and names the Kings Title, <hi>Dondagh:</hi> whereupon the King if pleas'd anſwers, <hi>Namady,</hi> that is, <hi>I thank you,</hi> if not, ſits ſilent. If it be a perſon of Quality, and his Subject, the King perhaps cauſes a Matt to be ſpread on the ground, upon which ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the diſtance of a Pace, he declares what he hath to requeſt. But if he be a Foraigner that comes onely to Salute the King, without any further Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony he is conducted to him, receiving an immediate diſpatch. If the perſon have any Propoſition, Petition or Complaint to make, upon notice thereof, a <hi>Jilly,</hi> or Interpreter is call'd, who coming with his Bow in his hand, opens to the King the whole matter, ſentence by ſentence; whereto according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Affair, he receives anſwer, with promiſe, if upon a Complaint, that as ſoon as he hath heard what the other party can ſay in his defence, he will forthwith give Judgment according to Right.</p>
                  <p>If any man come to thank the King for doing Exemplary Juſtice in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Cauſe,
<note place="margin">How the King is thank'd for doing good Juſtice.</note> after his Preſents receiv'd, he deveſts himſelf of all his Clothes and Ornaments, ſaving onely a little Cloth to cover his <hi>Pudenda;</hi> ſo caſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf backwards upon the ground, and inſtantly turning again, riſes upon one knee, takes up earth with his hand, and lays it upon his head; then leaning with one elbow upon the earth, he ſays three times, <hi>Dondagh:</hi> whereupon the King anſwers ſome times, <hi>Namady,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>I thank you;</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times otherwiſe, as he thinks fit.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Addreſs uſually is perform'd in his own Houſe in the preſence of his chiefeſt Wife. But ſuch as concern Juſtice, or the State of the Countrey, he hears in the Council-Houſe, in the preſence of the Lords of the Council: This Aſſembly they call <hi>Simannoe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When ſome Eminent Perſon ſent from a Neighbor King deſires Audience, one of the Kings Wives goes with a Preſent, and tells him who ſent it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Perſon appears before the King, and takes earth.</p>

                  <figure/>
                  <p>This Addreſs the King receives in his <hi>Simannoe,</hi> or Council-Houſe, being open on all ſides, with great attendance round about. After this Gratulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Salutation, the Ambaſſador deſires leave to relate his Embaſſie, but is put off till the next day; ſo retiring, he diverts himſelf till the appointed time in Feaſts and Sportive Recreations.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſador receives Anſwer by the Kings Direction from a <hi>Jilly,</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter; after which they ſhew the Ambaſſador and his Retinue the place where they are to remain; where the Kings Slaves bring them Water to waſh, and the Kings Women bring very neatly dreſt, in Diſhes ſet on their heads, Rice and Fleſh, much or little, according to the number of his Attendants. The Entertainment ended, the King ſends him for his Welcome, Wine, and other Preſents, either a Kettle, Baſon, or ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>If any <hi>European</hi> Merchant bring the King a Preſent, he is invited to eat with him; but with no <hi>Black,</hi> how great of State ſoever, will he eat out of the ſame Diſh: but lets their Meat be carried by his Women to the place where they are.</p>

                  <p>They believe that their Friends after their death become Spirits; which they call <hi>Jannack,</hi> or <hi>Jannanen,</hi> and ſay, that they are omniſcient to take cogniſance of all Cauſes which happen among them; and therefore they hold familiar Colloquies with them, telling them all troubles and adverſities under which they labour.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that go into the Woods to Hunt,
<note place="margin">The Offers or Sacrifices to their deceaſed Parents.</note> and take Elephants, or Buffles, or begin any other dangerous Enterprize, go firſt and offer to the Spirit of their deceaſed Parents, either a Cow, or Wine, or Rice, which they leave on the Grave.</p>
                  <p>The high times of Sacrificing are kept among them with great Joy, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and Singing. But beſides thoſe ſolemn times, the King calls upon the Souls of his Father and Mother almoſt in every Matter of difficulty.</p>
                  <p>They believe the Spirits of their near acquaintance are protectors of their Houſes, and therefore in all Sorrow and Sickneſs they bring Wine and Food out of their Houſes into the Way, and there leave it for an Offering.</p>
                  <p>They ſay farther, that theſe Spirits have their habitation in the Woods: whereupon all that are diſtreſſed, and look for help from God by them, go thither, complaining and lamenting their affliction; but with awful reverence: for how great ſoever any man is, yet he fears very much in the preſence of God. For this cauſe all acts of Devotion are performed in thoſe ſolitary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; into which no Women or Children may be permitted to come.</p>
                  <p>In this Place twice; thrice, or oftner in the year, according to the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Seaſon, and when Hunting is good, all ſorts of Meat-offerings are brought to feed the Spirits.</p>
                  <p>They ſay Circumciſion hath been received among them from hand to hand from all antiquity,
<note place="margin">Circumciſion.</note> and that God hath commanded it.</p>
                  <p>They Circumciſe Children at half a year old, though ſometime, by the Mothers tenderneſs, they are kept to the ſecond or third year; but then the Cure proves more difficult, becauſe the Children going naked, the Air and Sun make the Cut ſwell and feſter; which they heal by waſhing with the Juice of green Herbs.</p>
                  <p>They have together with Circumciſion another Cuſtom, which they call <hi>Belli-Paaro,</hi> whereby they ſay they become incorporated into the ſociety of Spirits, and therefore take part with them in eating the before-mention'd Offerings. But this is kept hidden from Women, and unskilful perſons; to whom they affirm, that the <hi>Jaananen,</hi> or Spirits themſelves eat it: And if any
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:56692:255"/>dare be ſo bold, as either out of covetouſneſs or curioſity to peep into this ſecret, if it happen to be known, they are by ſome ſudden and undiſcovered means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made away.</p>
                  <p>The received Tokens of <hi>Belli-Paaro</hi> are ſeldom ſhewn, <hi>viz.</hi> once in twenty,
<note place="margin">When it is done.</note> or five and twenty years, and then they tell ſtrange Stories of it, and how they came to the high favour of receiving them: which are nothing elſe but ſome rows of Cuts, from the Neck along both the Shoulder-blades.
<note place="margin">What they are.</note> Thoſe that have them are accounted very underſtanding perſons: and when they grow old, in all Aſſemblies and Councils, relating to State-Affairs, or Cauſes Criminal, wherein Life is concern'd, may be preſent, and give their opinion.</p>
                  <p>Of the manner of receiving theſe Marks, take this ſhort account:</p>
                  <p>There is by the Kings order a place in the Wood appointed of about two or three miles compaſs,
<note place="margin">They are received in the Wood.</note> whither are brought the Youths that have not been Marked, by main force and againſt their wills, becauſe they believe they ſhall be kill'd or chang'd; and therefore they take a ſorrowfull farewell of their Friends and Parents, as if they went indeed to their death.</p>
                  <p>When now they are lodged in the Wood, continually ſome Ancient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which have had the Tokens of <hi>Belli-Paaro</hi> very long, attend to teach and inſtruct them what behavior they ſhall uſe; leading them a ſtrange and <hi>uncouth</hi> Dance, and cauſing them to learn ſome <hi>Verſes</hi> which they call <hi>Belli-Dong,</hi> being Songs and Encomiums of <hi>Belli,</hi> ſtuffed with obſcene and ſcurrulous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                  <p>Hither the women bring Rice, <hi>Bonano's,</hi> and all ſort of Fruit, prepared for an Offering, and give it up to the <hi>Soggonoe,</hi> that is, the <hi>Ancienteſt Marked,</hi> whom the women hold for Saints, praying them by all means to hinder that their Children in the change ſhould not be burnt to aſhes. Thither alſo goes the King, and ſtays two or three days.</p>
                  <p>This living in the Wood continues four or five years; during which time there are new comers daily brought thither.</p>
                  <p>None unmark'd may come near this place, onely women in manner before mention'd, and they too muſt come and go ſinging with a loud noiſe; for if it fall out that any paſs by ſilently, they are taken away by the Spirits, without ever being heard of more.</p>
                  <p>When they come out of this Wood,
<note place="margin">What they do when they come out of the Wood.</note> they are brought by the <hi>Belli-Soggonoe</hi> into Huts made for that purpoſe, where they are permitted to eat and drink familiarly with the women, and afterwards are anew inſtructed in cauſes which concern the Wars, Juſtice, and Government.</p>
                  <p>At their firſt coming abroad, they behave themſelves as if they then came newly into the world, not knowing (or at leaſt wiſe ſo pretending) where their Parents dwell, and ſo totally changed, that they have forgot their Names; nor indeed do they the meaneſt or moſt common act of Childhood, without being firſt tutor'd therein by the <hi>Soggonoe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this their beginning appearance,
<note place="margin">How they are clothed when they come out of the Wood.</note> they are habited with Plumes of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Caps made of the Bark of Trees, with long flappets hanging down before their Faces. After ſome days ſtay in the Huts, in ſuch array, with Bells about their Legs, and Beads mixt with Leopards Teeth about their Necks, and their Hair plaited, they are brought openly to the Sporting-place, where the women and other people of all ſorts, of all Towns and Villages lying round about, are gathered together to ſee them Dance the <hi>Belli-Dance,</hi> the poſtures whereof they learned in the Wood.</p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:56692:256"/>
                  <p>Thoſe whoſe dull apprehenſions,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Belli</hi>-Dance.</note> or unactive bodies have not carried them forward to perform their parts in this Dance, are contemned, as having ſpent their time in abhorr'd idleneſs.</p>
                  <p>After the end of the Dance, every one call'd by his new name, receiv'd in the <hi>Holy Wood</hi> from the <hi>Soggenoe,</hi> is delivered to his Parents with theſe words, <hi>Theſe are your Parents or Tutors, learn hereafter to know one another again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">The mark'd muſt ſwear by <hi>Belli-Paaro.</hi>
                     </note> Every one of them muſt ſwear by <hi>Belli-Paaro,</hi> that is, by <hi>Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, That he will do the Command impoſed on him; that he will not withdraw out of this or that Town, nor reproach any perſons or places, or carry any thing away, or hinder the paſsing of the</hi> Canoo's, <hi>or keep Oyl, Nuts, and Houſes:</hi> Then they put a Stick in the Earth, with a buſh of Ruſhes, reſembling a Broom on the top, and Charm it by theſe words, <hi>Hucquonono Hucquo, Hucquonono Hucquo, Hucquonono Hucquo,</hi> which concern <hi>Belli</hi> onely, and are not uſed otherwiſe in the Language. Who ever offends againſt this Oath, receives puniſhment according to the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the matter.</p>
                  <p>In caſe of breaking this Determination,
<note place="margin">The Puniſhment of ſuch as tranſgreſs this Adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the Falſifier is laid into a Basket with Thorns, and ſo rowl'd thorow the Town, and back again, till that his skin and fleſh is torn; beſides they give him <hi>Buaſille,</hi> that is, Pepper mixt with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they put into his Mouth, Eyes, Ears, and ſtrow or ſprinkle it over his whole Body.</p>
                  <p>But the Trial of Adultery by this kind of Oath,
<note place="margin">The Adjuration in caſe of Adultery.</note> is made by the Magiſtrate after many Pre-admonitions, and inflicted onely upon the tranſgreſſing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, according to this Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>The complaining Husband, who will have his Wife tryed by <hi>Belli,</hi> or be deliver'd up to the Spirits, as they call them; brings her in the Evening into the Sporting-place, before the Council aſſembled for that purpoſe; where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the calling of the <hi>Jannanen</hi> into her company, ſhe is blindfolded, that ſhe may ſee nothing, and admoniſh'd to forſake her evil life, and not go to any but her own Husband; and preſently a great noiſe and murmure is rais'd, as if Spirits did appear, with ſome not intelligible (though articulate) Sounds, that are interpreted aloud before the whole Congregation, with threatnings, that if ever ſhe commit ſuch an offence again, ſhe ſhall be puniſh'd according to her deſerts; and if ſhe be ever thereafter detected of the like Crime, ſhe ſhall, together with her Paramour, be carried away by the <hi>Jannanen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner, ſome are adjur'd for breaking the Decrees made by the King, or the Magiſtrate, for Bloudſhed, and for taking away the Slave of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ſelling him, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Now this taking away of Offenders by the <hi>Jannanen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How Offenders are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the <hi>Jannanen.</hi>
                     </note> is made terrible by this means; In the Evening with a great ruſhing noiſe comes into the Town, their <hi>Belli. Soggenoe</hi> having certain Rattle-clappers, making a great noiſe, ſo that the common people wonder at the hurliburly; being come to the Sporting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, where the Offenders are ſet, they take with them as many as are there, with ſuch a fearful Clamour, that the Out-cries of the Offenders cannot be heard; ſo are they hurried to the <hi>Holy Wood,</hi> from whence they never return. During the time of this Performance, no Woman or unmark'd perſon may look out of the houſe, upon pain of being fetcht from thence in like manner.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Belli-Paaro</hi> is alſo common in <hi>Hondo,
<note place="margin">Where the <hi>Belli-Parro</hi> is in uſe.</note> Folgia, Gala,</hi> and <hi>Gebbe;</hi> alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Bolmeſſes</hi> and <hi>Cilmeſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though it is apparent enough,
<note place="margin">How highly <hi>Belli</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd by them.</note> what it is to be kill'd by <hi>Belli,</hi> for that
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:56692:256"/>the Execution of <hi>Belli</hi> is but the Kings Form of Juſtice; yet no man dares for fear of Death, take upon him to interrupt it: For the <hi>Belli-Soggenoe</hi> hold this Ceremony to be ſo Sacred, and have it in ſuch high eſteem, that the King himſelf (who is as it were the Head of <hi>Belli</hi>) declares himſelf his Vaſſal, and to be ſubject to his Myſteries. Indeed he takes care in the Council,
<note place="margin">Who are free from <hi>Belli.</hi>
                     </note> that none be adjur'd by <hi>Belli,</hi> nor that the <hi>Jannanen</hi> take away any without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or conſent; onely inflicting that Puniſhment upon his own Subjects, though ſometimes a few have dar'd to reſiſt it, and fly into another Province rather than ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>And here we may obſerve, that none is given up to the <hi>Jannanen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Water to know if any be guilty or not guilty.</note> but with good Conſideration, and upon clear Evidence of Guilt; to prove which, they have a Water of Curſing, boyl'd of Barks and Herbs, which by the Elders of the Myſtery is put upon the hand of the charg'd Party lukewarm; if he be innocent, it will not hurt; but will corrode and burn the Skin off, if guilty.</p>
                  <p>Thus is Adultery, Thievery, and Lying try'd.</p>
                  <p>The foreſaid Water of Curſing, or rather of Divination, wherewith they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort the Truth in all doubtful matters, as we have related, is thus prepared. The <hi>Bollimo</hi> takes the thick Rind of the great Tree <hi>Nelle,</hi> and the Rind of <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> growing alſo upon a great Tree bearing Seed, uſed in the making of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their Arrows; and mixed with water, as we ſaid, is given to them to drink who are accuſed of <hi>Sovach.</hi> Thirdly, He takes ſome leaves of the <hi>Borrow</hi>-Tree, from which beaten and preſſed proceeds a white Juyce, which with ſome mitigating Ingredients makes an excellent Purge, but the ſtrongeſt taken alone is mortal Poyſon. Moreover, the <hi>Bollimo</hi> adds to the before-recited long Pepper, and a piece of <hi>Mannoone</hi> about the bigneſs of a Bean. All theſe are put into a little Pot or Horn, and filled up with the Urine of a young man that had never known a woman. This done, they ſcrape in a little <hi>Bonda,</hi> that is, red Dying-weed. Laſtly, daubing the four ſides of the Pot with <hi>Mannoone</hi> chawed in the mouth, it is ready to be ſet on the fire, which muſt be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the open Heaven in the morning at Sun-riſe, or in the evening at Sun-ſet, of green Wood. As ſoon as the water begins to boil, the <hi>Bollimo</hi> takes a piece of <hi>Domboo,</hi> being a Tree that bears fruit like a Medlar, and puts it under the Seeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pot; in the mean time trying whether the Ingredients have boyl'd enough, and repeating ſecretly the names of the ſuſpected perſons, or of other matters,
<note place="margin">How this Sorcery-water is uſed.</note> to which the Witchcraft muſt be applied. When all is ready, the <hi>Bollimo</hi> takes the arms or legs of the ſuſpected perſons, and waſheth them clean with fair water. At length he puts his Divining-Staff, which is bruiſed and tufted at the end, into the Pot, and drops or preſſeth the water out of it upon the arm or leg of the ſuſpected perſon, muttering theſe words over it: <hi>Is he guilty of this, or hath he done this or that;</hi> if yea, <hi>then let it ſcald or burn him, till the very skin come off.</hi> Now if the perſon remain unhurt they hold him innocent, and proceed to the trial of another, till the guilty be diſcovered; and this is done ſo long, till the name of the guilty, or the perſon be found out.</p>
                  <p>The Criminal thus found, is without any long procraſtinating put to death. The manner of which, according to the variety of Places is different; but the moſt uſual thus: The Executioner takes the Offender, and leads him with his Hands tied behind, and his Eyes blind-folded, either into an open Field or a Wood; whither being come, the Offender upon his Knees, his Head bowed down, he firſt runs through the Body with an Aſſagay, or Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:56692:257"/>and afterwards chops off his Head with an Axe: for they do not believe he is dead till his Head be cut off. The Carcaſe cut into four quarters, after great lamentations, they leave in the Field as a Prey to the Beaſts and Fowl, but the Friends take away the Head as a great Preſent, and boiling it in a Kettle, drink up the Broth, but hang the Scull by their <hi>Fetiſſo,</hi> or Idol.</p>
                  <p>The like Trial is alſo made of other Offences among the <hi>Blacks</hi> in <hi>Quoia;</hi> and alſo in <hi>Gala, Hondo, Bolm, Cilm,</hi> and many other Places: ſo that every one had need to be circumſpect and careful to prevent ſuſpicion, eſpecially the Women, who are for every trifling Caprichio of their Husbands, brought in queſtion of their Honeſty.</p>
                  <p>Now if one of the King's Women laſh out,
<note place="margin">The Puniſhment of chief Women for Adultery.</note> or go abroad after other Men, and the King be enraged againſt it, then he cauſeth them to be ſo poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that if they touch any Maſculine perſon, ſmall or great, they ſuddenly fall into a kind of Epileptick Fit; according to which three Wives of the preſent King <hi>Flamboere</hi> ſuffered: one of which receiving her Daughters Child, not knowing it was a Boy, fell into a Swoon, and might therein have died, if the other Women had not run to the King, and beſeeched him that the <hi>Bollimo</hi> might releaſe her from the Curſe. But becauſe this is an extraordinary thing, no other but the King himſelf may put it in execution, and that very ſeldom.</p>
                  <p>¶ ANd as the Men have the Marks of <hi>Belli,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Marks of <hi>Neſogge;</hi>
                     </note> ſo here the Women have a Mark of Obligation, which they call <hi>Neſogge;</hi> which firſt took origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from <hi>Goula,</hi> and done in manner following: They bring ten, twelve, or more Maids of full Age, as alſo Women, into a peculiar place in the Wood not far from the Town; where firſt Huts are made for them, then a Woman comes out of <hi>Goula,</hi> whom they call <hi>Soghwilly,</hi> to be the chiefeſt in this Work of the <hi>Garnoer,</hi> or <hi>Vala Sandyla,</hi> as they term it. This <hi>Soghwilly,</hi> or Prieſteſs gives the Aſſembly Hens to eat, with the Obligation to ſtay with her in that place, which ſhe names <hi>Sandy-Latee,</hi> that is, <hi>Hens of the Agreement.</hi> After that ſhe ſhaves off their Hair, and the next day brings them to a Brook in the Wood, where the aforeſaid <hi>Soghwilly,</hi> by Inciſion cut out the Mother, not without great pain and terror; then waſhing and healing the Wound with green Herbs, which ſometimes requires ten or twelve days time.</p>
                  <p>They ſtay there afterwards three or four Moneths, to learn Dances and Verſes of <hi>Zaudy;</hi> which are not onely difficult to learn, but contain very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that can be ſung with honeſty, by any that do but pretend to be chaſte and modeſt. During their abode together in receſs they go as naked as they were born, their Clothes being taken away at the firſt coming of the <hi>Soghwilly.</hi> When the time draws near that they ſhall be brought from thence, they make a kind of Garments of the Rind of Trees, Dy'd red and yellow; and their Friends are permitted to bring them Arm-Rings, Beads, Bells, to put about their Legs when they Dance, and other things to adorn themſelves at their coming forth. When they enter the Town, or Village, where the People ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together as if it were ſome Holiday, the <hi>Soghwilly</hi> leads to the Sporting-place, where one ſits Drumming with two Sticks on a round hollow piece of Wood. By the ill-tun'd Muſick of which (if ſo we may call it) Inſtrument, the <hi>Simodiuno,</hi> or <hi>Sandi-Simodiuno,</hi> that is, <hi>Children of Sandy,</hi> every one underſtands his time; and they all ſeek to exceed one another in Dancing.</p>
                  <p>This Solemnity ended, they make theſe Women to ſwear by <hi>Noe-Soggo,</hi> that
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:56692:257"/>is, by their Faithfulneſs: and thenceforth all people muſt give credit to their words.</p>
                  <p>They have no ſelect Days ſet apart for their Ceremonies,
<note place="margin">They have no Holy-days.</note> nor do they keep holy the ſeventh, but the firſt Day of the New-Moon, when they ſee it appear; for then they do no manner of work: neither do they any work in Planting on that day when any one drinks <hi>Quony,</hi> nor when any one dies in the ſame Town; for they believe if they ſhould, that the <hi>Mille</hi> and Rice would grow red, ſeeing, as they ſay, it is a day of Blood; but they may freely go a Hunting.</p>
                  <p>Thus far we have thought fit to give an account of what concerns the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Quoia;</hi> now we ſhall, for the better connexion and underſtanding of what before is mention'd, and that which is yet to be related, give you the Narrative in what manner the <hi>Karou's</hi> were diſpoſſeſt of their Countrey by the <hi>Folgia's;</hi> and <hi>Vey, Puy,</hi> and <hi>Quoia-Berkoma</hi> ſubjected.</p>

But wavering fortune that minds nothing leſs than the continuance of friendſhip, will blemiſh his new gotten glory, with
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:56692:259"/>a dire and unexpected miſhap; for ſcarce were the minds of the <hi>Vey's</hi> or <hi>Karou's</hi> united, but there came out of <hi>Gala, Miminique,</hi> Son of the aforeſaid named <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimaſſah,</hi> with a great Army of <hi>Gala's</hi> and others, to make War upon the <hi>Karou's</hi> and <hi>Vey's,</hi> to whoſe deſign his Father was not unwitting, having voluntarily forgotten the kindneſſes received from <hi>Flonikerry's</hi> Arms, in the Conqueſt of his now acquired Dominion. Wherefore <hi>Flonikerry</hi> upon the firſt intelligence, drew together his Forces, to which joyning the <hi>Veys,</hi> he formed a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army; wherewith marching towards the Enemy, they ſoon met and came to a Battel, wherein the <hi>Gala's</hi> at firſt by their multitude put the <hi>Karou's</hi> to a diſorderly Retreat, which <hi>Flonikerry</hi> a valiant and undaunted perſon ſeeing, and not uſed to ſhrink before his Enemies, digged with his hand a hole in the ground, and put his knees in it, with a reſolution, either to die there, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Conqueror over his Enemies. And indeed he had his deſire in the one, for after a long and ſharp Conteſt, at length as it were covered with Aſſagayes and Arrows, he was ſlain on the ſpot. However, his men gathering freſh courage to revenge their Princes death, Rally'd and gave a freſh Charge upon their Enemies with ſuch fury, that they turn'd the fortune of the day, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſolely maſters of the Field.</p>
                     <p>But the death of <hi>Flonikerry,</hi> whoſe body they buried in the Fort <hi>Quillone,</hi> was ſometime kept ſecret, till they ſent for his Brother <hi>Zyllymanque</hi> to take his Charge, who immediately accepting the ſame, purſued the Victory, and drew near to the Camp, where he ſoon brought under the <hi>Puymonow,</hi> giving their Spoil as a Booty to his Souldiers.</p>

                     <p>Soon after he went to the River <hi>Maquelbary,</hi> or <hi>Rio Galinhas,</hi> where he ſubdu'd the <hi>Quilliga-Monou</hi> after a little reſiſtance; and with them he ended his Wars, and retir'd with his Forces to <hi>Tomby,</hi> his old habitation; but was at length poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, as was thought, leaving behind him ſeveral ſons, which were but little, and not capable to manage their Fathers Dominion.</p>

                        <hi>Cape Lahou</hi> yields many of theſe Clothes, which the Inhabitants barter for Salt; which they, according to their own report ſend abroad by Slaves or otherwiſe, who with it travel ſo far into the Countrey, till they come to white People, that Ride on Mules and Aſſes, and uſe Lances for Arms; but they are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther white, as the <hi>Europeans.</hi> By this Deſcription we cannot but imagine, theſe Mungrel <hi>Whites</hi> they mention, muſt without peradventure be <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Barbary.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Blacks</hi> of other Places exchange theſe Cloathes for yellow Arm-Rings, and ſometimes, but ſeldom, for Beads. Heretofore ſome Gold was to be had; but now that Trade is loſt here, and carried to <hi>Akara.</hi>

                     <p>In the beginning of <hi>December</hi> this <hi>Sakkoo</hi> ſends a <hi>Canoo</hi> to <hi>Atzyn</hi> and <hi>Little Kommany,</hi> and all places on the <hi>Gold-Coaſt,</hi> with <hi>Negro's;</hi> where they throw ſome compounded Conjuring-ſtuff into the Sea, uſing ſome formal words in doing it; which is done onely to free it from Hericanes, or Whirlwinds, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Storms. So ſoon as this <hi>Canoo</hi> returns, the Merchants come with their Cloathes to the <hi>Gold-Coaſt,</hi> but in ſuch order, that no more may come off till the firſt come back, for the prevention of the hinderances of one another. The five Band Villages have the priority in coming off, and after thoſe of the ſix Band: this continues till <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May:</hi> when the Sea begins to run high, then the King's <hi>Canoo</hi> comes as before, uſing the ſame formality, and returning, the <hi>Gold-Coaſt</hi> Trade ends for that Year.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Quaqua-Blacks</hi> have a well-govern'd State according to their Mode: As for example, thoſe that are Fiſhers muſt all ſo remain, without daring to alter their Employment: As likewiſe all Merchants are ſo preferred there, that no other may deal in fair Laces, and Garments of <hi>Akori,</hi> but they; inſomuch that all others who have thoſe Commodities, are neceſſitated to put them into the Merchants hands.</p>
                     <p>The method of their Worſhip,
<note place="margin">Religion</note> if any, is Diabolical, ſacrificing Men to their Idols, and thereto ſo addicted, that they will not be won to alter it; yet cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous enough to Strangers, from whom they endeavour to conceal thoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd Oblations.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This Caſtle was judg'd an antient Building,
<note place="margin">Its Antiquity.</note> from ſeveral marks of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about it; as firſt by a decay'd Battery, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> repaired ſome years ago, retaining the Name of <hi>The French Battery,</hi> becauſe it ſeems to have been built by the <hi>French;</hi> who, as the Inhabitants ſay, before the coming of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> harbour'd there. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> when they won it, found the Numerical Figures of the Year Thirteen hundred, but were not able to make any thing of the two following Characters. In a ſmall place within alſo may be ſeen a Writing Carved in Stone between two old Pillars, but ſo impair'd and worn out by the Weather, that it is not legible: The next is the Magazine, which ſeems firſt to have been built in the Year Fourteen hundred eighty four, in the Reign of <hi>John</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as appears by Figures of the Year upon the Gate, ſtanding yet ſo clear and plain, as if made but a few years before.
<note place="margin">Its Form.</note> The Building conſiſts of hard Stone in double rows, between which the vacancies fill'd with Earth, ſcituate for the moſt part upon a high Rock; againſt which on one ſide the Sea beats, ſo that it is difficult to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted; on the other ſide incloſed with four ſtrong Bulwarks, two on the Sea-Coaſt, which are the ſtrongeſt, and other two on the Land-ſide. The Walls are but low towards the Sea, becauſe the Flankers built about it are very high; but to the Landward the Walls are lofty and ſtrong for defence. It is in the narroweſt part fourteen Rods broad, and two and thirty Rods long, beſides the Out-works reaching from the River to the Banks of the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> took it from the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty ſeven; at which time it had towards the Sea two Batteries, each ſtrengthen'd with ſix good Pieces of Ordnance, whereas towards the Land, oppoſite to the Mountain <hi>St. Jago:</hi> where the greateſt ſtrength was required they had but one Battery, with ſix Mortar-Pieces; and toward the North-Eaſt but two ſmall Pieces upon an old Barracado'd Gate.</p>
                     <p>Over againſt the Caſtle on the Weſt,
<note place="margin">The Mountain St. <hi>Jago.</hi>
                        </note> beyond the River, lieth the Mountain <hi>St. Jago,</hi> ſo call'd from a little Chappel, formerly erected there; upon which the <hi>Dutch</hi> made a Redoubt of Earth immediately after the taking it, to hinder the approaching and coming up of an Enemy to the Mountain. This new Sconce holds four and twenty Rods ſquare, and twelve Foot in heighth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with a Stone Wall.</p>
                     <p>Beyond <hi>Mount St. Jago</hi> lieth another of the like heighth, from whence onely <hi>St. Jago</hi> can receive damage, the reſt lying at greater diſtance, and much lower.</p>
                     <p>Over againſt <hi>St. Jago,</hi> in the place where, in the time of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> ſtood two Lodges, is now raiſed a Battery, Planted with great Guns, the better to defend the Fort againſt <hi>St. Jago's Hill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On this Quarter the Caſtle was very weak while the <hi>Portugals</hi> held it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Breaſt-works, and ſcarce Fenced with a Mud-Wall: onely there
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:56692:267"/>ſtood a Battery with ſix Mortar-Pieces, and two ſmall Pieces upon an old Gate, as we mention'd before: But on the Sea-quarter they made it ſtrongeſt, and Planted their chiefeſt and beſt Guns: for they were of opinion, that no Cannon could be got up the Mountain <hi>St. Jago,</hi> and therefore took ſo little care thereof, that they had ſuffer'd the Mountain to be over-grown with Buſhes, ſuppoſing that the Trees alone would be a ſufficient hinderance to any Enemy; but they found themſelves greatly miſtaken therein; though indeed otherwiſe this Fort, by the ſtrong Walls, and great heighth, hath ſufficient Defence.</p>
                     <p>In this Caſtle riſes a fair Fountain of Water,
<note place="margin">Fountains of Water.</note> and in the <hi>French</hi>-Battery ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in both which may be kept Proviſion of Water for two hundred men for ſix moneths. Beſides thoſe Fountains there is a Trench over againſt the Town <hi>Myne,</hi> by the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Dana,</hi> cut out of the Rocks, being enough to contain a thouſand Pipes or more, whereinto all the waſte water falling from the two beforemention'd places, and from the Souldiers Courts of Guard, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth together.</p>
                     <p>This Trench without doubt, coſt the <hi>Portugals</hi> a very tedious and heavy labour.</p>
                     <p>By this water drawn from hence, the Inhabitants are furniſh'd; as alſo the King of <hi>Fetu</hi> with his Army, when in War, ſupply'd, and now accommodates the <hi>Dutch</hi> with marvellous plenty.</p>
                     <p>The conveniencies for Merchandiſe, Proviſion of Food, neceſſary Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition for Wars, and other Commodities, are in great abundance within this Fort; for that the Ships coming out of the Countrey, readily unload, and go back again; there being a Key for Landing or Shipping of all ſorts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities at a Water-Gate made for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> ſuffer'd great prejudice ſo long as the <hi>Portugal's</hi> poſſeſs'd this Fort, becauſe they endeavour'd by all means to hinder their Trade with the <hi>Blacks;</hi> whereupon they conſulted, and deſign'd to get it from them, yet always were fruſtrated in their attempts, till the year Sixteen hundred thirty and ſeven; at which time the Caſtle was in a mean condition, by reaſon of great diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the <hi>Portugal's:</hi> Then the General of <hi>Guinea</hi> and <hi>Angola</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted by the <hi>Kaboſeroe's</hi> or Chief people of the <hi>Myne,</hi> that the time was to undertake ſomewhat about it. This Intelligence he communicated by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company, who provided nine Ships well Man'd, Arm'd, and Victual'd, which in the Year Sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty ſeven, the Five and twentieth of <hi>July,</hi> under Collonel <hi>Hans Koin,</hi> went forth from <hi>Farnambuck</hi> to the <hi>African</hi> Coaſt, and ſoon arriv'd there in ſafety; whereof he ſent notice to General <hi>Yperen,</hi> who reſided in the Town <hi>Moure</hi> two miles lower, by Letter, to this effect: <hi>That he was there, by Command of</hi> Grave Maurice, <hi>and the Council, furniſh'd with Souldiers to undertake the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. He deſir'd therefore to know where was a fit place to Land upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Quarters, and to adviſe with him in what manner the Enterpriſe might be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently accompliſh'd: That he would endeavour to win the</hi> Blacks <hi>with all poſſible Perſwaſions, great Promiſes, and Rewards, to aſsiſt the Company; and withal, would watch the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>who lay upon the Road, and labour to prevent all other Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments; That they muſt keep all ſecret, that the Enterpriſe might not be diſappointed: and in the interim, he would be upon the Road before</hi> Albine, <hi>or</hi> Aſſine, <hi>to expect an Anſwer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While thus <hi>Koyn</hi> ply'd upon the Coaſt, the <hi>Negroes</hi> come with eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

                        <hi>Canoo's</hi> to his Fleet, and ask for <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Merchandiſe, to barter for Elephants-Teeth: But when 'twas anſwer'd they had no Wares, the <hi>Blacks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan greatly to doubt; but the <hi>Dutch</hi> to aſſure them friendſhip, according to the cuſtom of the Countrey, let ſome drops of Sea-water fall into their eyes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with for the preſent ſatisfi'd, they departed. At length the Fleet appearing before <hi>Albine</hi> and <hi>Aſsine,</hi> the <hi>Blacks</hi> came again with their <hi>Canoo's</hi> to Trade, but our men put them off with delays for three or four days; whereupon the <hi>Blacks</hi> ſaid, that theſe of <hi>Fetiſſon</hi> had underſtood by their Guardian <hi>God,</hi> that ſeven big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Ships were at hand, at whoſe coming their Wares would fall in Price. <hi>Koin,</hi> who little regarded that, and had ſomewhat elſe in his mind, wrote Letters again almoſt of the ſame Contents, whereto for anſwer he receiv'd Orders to remove with his Fleet before <hi>Commendo,</hi> which was ſpeedily perform'd; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inquiry made for the fitteſt place to Land; to this purpoſe they ſent out a Scout, who returning, brought intelligence that there was no Landing between the <hi>Myne</hi> and <hi>Cape de Kors,</hi> but onely a Muſquet-ſhot from the <hi>Myne,</hi> where the Salt-River at low Water was not knee deep, that the Mountain of <hi>St. Jago</hi> might be eaſily attempted with ſmall Shot, and that the Line was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be long defended: That the freſh River which lay about half a mile from the <hi>Myne</hi> had excellent Water, and that the way from <hi>Cape de Kors</hi> to the <hi>Myne,</hi> was very fit to March on in good order with the Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>After much courting, at length, and opening to them their whole deſign, they gat the Youths of <hi>Commendo</hi> with Gifts, and promiſes to furniſh them with Water and other Proviſion; whereupon on the Four and twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> they went off to <hi>Cape de Kors,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">They land at <hi>Cape de Kors.</hi>
                        </note> and there Landed with great <hi>Canoo's;</hi> and on the Twenty fifth day being Tueſday, drew in good order to the <hi>Myne,</hi> being about eight hundred Land-Souldiers, and Five hundred Mariners, drawn up in three Companies. Coming about Noon to the freſh River, the Souldiers reſted and refreſh'd themſelves, ſome Scouts were ſent for diſcovery, who brought intelligence, that they diſcern'd about a thouſand <hi>Blacks</hi> lye at the hanging of a Hill; who having diſcover'd, purſu'd them with a great cry; upon this were ſent out four Muſquetteers, who venturing too far were loſt, and their heads by the <hi>Blacks,</hi> according to the manner of the Countrey cut off, and carried in triumph. But a greater force falling in, ſoon put them to flight, and poſſeſs'd the Hill whence the other were driven.</p>
                     <p>On Wedneſday the ſix and twentieth, thoſe of <hi>Commendo</hi> drew our Mariners to the Town of <hi>Myne,</hi> which they aſſaulted, and took all their Cattel.</p>
                     <p>The Commander in Chief bending his whole thoughts to take the Caſtle, caus'd in this interval two Paſſages to be made, by cutting up the Buſhes on the Mountain <hi>St. Jago;</hi> the one leading towards the Shore, by which to bring the Ammunition for the Souldiers; and the other upon the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain near the Fort. On Thurſday were brought two Pieces of Ordnance with a Mortar-Piece to <hi>Mount St. Jago,</hi> with which they made eight or ten Shot, beſides as many Granadoes, but they fell ſhort; whereas by the ſhooting of the Enemy from the Caſtle, two Centinels were kill'd. Then the <hi>Negroes</hi> of <hi>Commendo</hi> approached towards the Town of <hi>Myne;</hi> but driven back by the Enemies great Shot,
<note place="margin">The Caſtle Summon'd.</note> quickly retreated: Hereupon the Commander ſent a Drummer to ſummon the beſieg'd to ſurrender; to which the Governor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, That it was not in his power to conſent, without conferring with the Commanders of the Army, and the Citizens, and requir'd three days time; but that was deni'd, granting onely to the next day; however nothing was
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:56692:268"/>then done; for the Governor of the Fort, the day being ſpent, held the Gates ſhut, and would not admit the Drummer: Then the Forces from <hi>Mount St. Jago</hi> making a fierce Attacque, though with little Succeſs; and battering with their Cannon, a Meſſenger came forth, requiring the Letter ſent before by the Drummer; but that was deni'd: Whereupon after a ſhort Conſultation, Meſſengers were ſent to treat of an Agreement; during which Treaty, the <hi>Blacks</hi> of <hi>Commendo</hi> were requir'd to lay down Arms, and to uſe no force to the Husbandmen of the <hi>Myne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Articles offer'd by the Garriſon, were refus'd;
<note place="margin">Articles of Agreement.</note> but thoſe accepted that the Beleaguerers propos'd; being to this effect: They ſhall all with their Wives and Children, without reproach or abuſe, go forth ſafe with Life and Limb. Every one ſhall take their Apparel; but no Money either Gold or Silver. The Victor ſhall retain all the Merchandiſe, and Slaves, except twelve, which the owners may keep. All the Church-Ornaments and Utenſils, except of Gold and Silver, they ſhall take away with them. The <hi>Portugals, Mulattoes,</hi> and all their Houſholds provided with neceſſary Suſtenance, ſhall be carried to the Iſland <hi>St. Thome.</hi> The Governor of the Fort, and Souldiers, ſhall forthwith depart out of the Fort, and leave all the Ammunition for War, and the reſt of the Merchandiſe to the Victor. The Souldiers ſhall depart without Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours or Sword, and neither have lighted Match nor Bullets. Thus was this renowned Caſtle won and loſt in four days.
<note place="margin">The Booty.</note> The Booty of Ammunition and Arms found therein, were thirty Iron Pieces of Ordnance, nine thouſand weight of Spice, eight hundred great Iron Balls, ten Fats of ſmall Bullets, and three hundred Stone Bullets, ſix and thirty <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Swords, beſides Bowes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and other Utenſils of War. As ſoon as the Garriſon was drawn out, and come over to the Iſland <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> took poſſeſſion with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty Men. A former attempt had been made againſt this Caſtle, but ſucceeded unluckily; the manner this:</p>

                        <note place="margin">The fruitleſs attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Caſtle of <hi>Myne.</hi>
                        </note> One thouſand ſix hundred twenty five, came into <hi>Serre-Lions</hi> to refreſh his Men, being moſt of them ſick of the Bloody-Flux; where he found three other Ships, who had lay'n there two Moneths, undergoing great Miſery, Sickneſs, and other Calamities. The People of both the Parties being refreſhed and cured, determined to win the Caſtle of <hi>Myne,</hi> being about fifteen Ships and Ketches, with which they ſet forth the five and twentieth of <hi>September</hi> from <hi>Serre-Lions,</hi> and were the ninth of <hi>October</hi> upon the <hi>Grain-Coaſt,</hi> between <hi>Rio St. Paulo,</hi> and <hi>Rio Junk,</hi> in five Degrees and an half North Latitude, where they ſent a Ketch to the General for the <hi>Netherlands Weſt-India</hi> Company at <hi>Moure,</hi> to acquaint him with their coming, and that they intended to come with their Fleet before <hi>Kommony,</hi> and to Land there.</p>
                     <p>Being come on the twentieth of the ſame Moneth before <hi>Kommony,</hi>

This delay the Admiral and his Council of War thought would give too fair opportunity to the Enemy, and therefore reſolved to Land the Soldiers: but this reſolution was deferr'd by advice of thoſe of the Fort of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> till the coming of the General, becauſe of his great Intereſt with the Kings of <hi>Fetu, Sabou,</hi> and <hi>Kom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> in whoſe Favour much did conſiſt. But immediately after his arrival, which was on the four and twentieth, it was concluded the next day to go on with the Deſign. Four Ships therefore were order'd to lie cloſe before
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:56692:269"/>the Caſtle of the <hi>Myne,</hi> to amuſe the Enemy by continual Shooting for three days,
<note place="margin">They Land at <hi>Terra Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kine.</hi>
                        </note> till the other Soldiers might in the mean time draw up without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The five and twentieth they Land in <hi>Terra Pekine</hi> about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Soldiers and Mariners, with an hundred and fifteen <hi>Blacks</hi> brought from <hi>Maure</hi> with the General; who about Noon came within a mile of the Caſtle of <hi>Myne,</hi> and from thence, after two hours reſt, drew within ſhot of it; where they were ſaluted preſently with ſome great Guns, but without hurt: and ſo ſate down before the Caſtle behind a Hill, with reſolution that night to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench and make their Approaches. In the mean time, while the General went to the pitch of the Hill to view the Caſtle, the Soldiers being tir'd with heat and thirſt, ran from their Arms, and gat themſelves to reſt, without ſuſpicion of any Enemy;
<note place="margin">Were fallen upon by the Enemy.</note> but as ſoon as the Commanders were come upon the top of the Mountain, they were unawares fall'n upon by about two hundred <hi>Blacks,</hi> who, like mad furious Men, fell in and made great ſlaughter and deſtruction amongſt them; which bred ſuch a terrour and conſternation amongſt them, that they threw away their Arms, and leaping into the Water were drown'd. There remained ſlain,

<note place="margin">The General wounded.</note> the General himſelf wounded, came to extream diſtreſs, and carried out of the Fight, the reſt fled to <hi>Kommany;</hi> whither alſo the Ships ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their courſe: and by this means was that Deſign utterly overthrown. But now we return to the remainder of the precedent ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Preſently after the taking of this Caſtle, the Victors ſent a <hi>Canoo</hi> with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Governor of <hi>Atzin,</hi> thereby requiring him to ſurrender that Place: But he well knowing they could not come up to him in that ſeaſon of the year, anſwer'd, <hi>That he would keep the Fort for the King, and expect our Forces.</hi> Then by advice of the whole Council of War, the Redoubt upon <hi>St. Jago</hi> was repair'd, as alſo a Battery that was fall'n, adjoining to the Works of the Caſtle; from whence they may ſcowre the Shore of the River, and relieve the Sea-Battery.</p>
                     <p>On the Weſt-ſide of the Caſtle ſtands a pretty large Town,

                     <p>This Town is naturally very ſtrong, being (as we ſaid) ſhut up between the River and the Sea, ſo that the Enemy hath no other approach, than at the end of <hi>Kommany,</hi> where the <hi>Portugals,</hi> as a Security from the <hi>Blacks,</hi> had rais'd a Stone-wall from the Sea to the River, and made a Battery.</p>

                  <p>Proviſion here is very ſcarce, eſpecially Fruits and Bread-Corn; ſo that whatever <hi>Whites</hi> put into this Place to Trade, muſt upon neceſſity provide themſelves well with all neceſſary Proviſion.</p>
                  <p>The King hath (and not without cauſe) the repute of a Potent Prince,
<note place="margin">The Kings Power.</note> being able in time of War to bring fifteen or ſixteen thouſand Men into the Field.

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:56692:274"/>his Juriſdiction, keeps good Correſpondency with all <hi>Whites,</hi> without ſhewing more favour to one than another.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Little Akara</hi> has been many years the chiefeſt place of Trade upon the <hi>Gold-Coaſt,</hi> next <hi>Moure</hi> and <hi>Kormantyn;</hi>

                  <p>While Trading here was free to all, that is, till the <hi>Hollanders Weſt.

                  <p>The King of <hi>Akara</hi> ſuffers none out of <hi>Aquemhoe</hi> and <hi>Aquimera</hi> to come through his Countrey and Trade with the <hi>Whites,</hi> but reſerves that freedom to his own Subjects onely; who carry the Wares brought from the <hi>Europeans</hi> to <hi>Abonce,</hi> and exchange them there with great profit. Neither would this King ſuffer the <hi>Whites</hi> to ſet up a Store-houſe on Shore for Trade, but forc'd to ride with their Ships, Ketches, and Sloops before the Haven: yet ſome few years ſince he ſold to the <hi>Dutch</hi> a piece of Ground, whereon he hath permitted them to build a Store-houſe.</p>
                  <p>Adjoining to this they have ſo far incroached,

                  <p>At <hi>Great Akara</hi> the King hath appointed a Captain over the Merchants,

But at this day the Countrey is fill'd therewith, whereof they chiefly make Bread.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mille</hi> by the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Mieuw,</hi>

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:56692:280"/>The Seed bears a reſemblance of our Tares, but ſweeter of Taſte, and white, and grows with long Ears like Bearded-Wheat, or Rye. It attains perfect growth and maturity in three Moneths; then being cut down, it lies in the Field a Moneth to dry: And laſtly, the Ears cut off and bound in Bundles, and brought into their Huts, the Straw ſerves for a Cover to the Habitations. Of this (as we ſaid) being a Juicy and excellent Grain, they make Bread with little labour, conſidering it muſt not be Ground.</p>
                     <p>They have alſo Potatoe's, <hi>Jams</hi> or <hi>In-Jams,</hi> which grow like Turnips, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ground, and boil'd afford as good Food: So the <hi>Bananaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koves</hi> they uſe with equal advantage, as we Apples or Pears.</p>

                        <hi>Ananaſſes</hi> not much eaten, becauſe of their tartneſs; yet remarkable in this, that the longer they are kept, the more they Grow.</p>
                     <p>Of Lemmons and Oranges they have great plenty; yet the Inhabitants make little uſe of them, for the before-mention'd reaſon: But the Lemmons are by the <hi>European</hi> Merchants bought up, who Preſs out the Juyce into Veſſels to Tranſport.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Dogs they ſo frequently Eat,
<note place="margin">They are eaten.</note> that in many places they are brought to Market, and driven Coupled with Cords one to another. The firſt Gift that a man gives when he Buys his Nobility, is a Dog. The <hi>Blacks</hi> keep many of them, and have them in great eſteem.</p>

                     <p>Hens were brought hither by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi>

                     <p>There are alſo a kind of Green Birds, with Orange Spots on their Bills, and long Tails, which the <hi>Blacks</hi> call <hi>Ahuront,</hi> and we, Paraketo's:
<note place="margin">Paraketo's.</note> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other like the former, ſomewhat bigger, and of a Blood-red Colour, with a black Spot on their Bills, and a black Tail.</p>

                     <p>There are other Birds like Cranes, with a head like a Turky-Cock, but ſo miſchievouſly devouring, that the <hi>Blacks</hi> to prevent their coming down, carry them Food to the Mountains: they continually dabble in the Dirt, and all manner of noiſome Filth, that they ſtink, even at a diſtance, as bad as the moſt loathſome Carrion.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Water-Snipes, Turtle-Doves, with a black Ring on their Necks; Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, Spotted with white, but the Fleſh unſavoury; and Peacocks, in ſhape like ours, but with ſome difference of Feathers.</p>
                     <p>The Bird <hi>Pettoir</hi> the <hi>Blacks</hi> look upon as a great Preſager of good or ill Fortune, and therefore eſteem it much.</p>
                     <p>The Cranes, Hearons, Storks, Crows, and Lapwings, differ not much from thoſe with us; onely the Crows are Parti-colour'd, ſuch as we have in <hi>England</hi> about <hi>Royſton,</hi> and therefore ſtyl'd, <hi>Royſton-Crows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Owls, Batts, Gnats, and great black Piſmires, that make holes in the earth like Field-Mice, and do much hurt to Bees, which they rob both of Honey and Wax.</p>
                     <p>Land-Crabbs, or Tortoiſes, by them call'd <hi>Bonzeronzes,</hi> of a Purple Colour,
<note place="margin">Land-Crabs, or Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> which keep under ground like Moles, they eat with delight, as a moſt deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Dainty.</p>
                     <p>Serpents and Adders, of an extraordinary magnitude, are found here,
<note place="margin">Serpents.</note> uſing
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:56692:281"/>both the Land and Water; having a Belly and Mouth ſo big, that they can ſwallow Hens, and Geeſe whole: Some of the <hi>Negro's</hi> think their fleſh fit to be eaten; but how it nouriſhes, their Diſeaſes caus'd by ſuch foul Feeding, give the beſt account.</p>

                     <p>Divers Villages lying near the Sea,
<note place="margin">Salt.</note> have Salt-Pans; as <hi>Antin, Labbede, Sinko,</hi> and others; but the beſt are at <hi>Antin,</hi> and <hi>Sinko:</hi> from whence carry'd thorow the whole Countrey to be ſold.</p>
                     <p>They make their Salt very Fine and White,
<note place="margin">How it is made.</note> and with little trouble, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it needs to be but once boyl'd.

                     <p>The whole Countrey produces Gold,
<note place="margin">The Countrey is full of Gold.</note> which the <hi>Blacks</hi> call <hi>Chilea;</hi> ſome found on the Shore, and at Low-water, ſought for by the Women, and found by Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the valew of a Noble.</p>
                     <p>But that which chiefly comes to <hi>Europe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">From whence the Gold comes.</note> is Digged out of the Rivers, or Mynes by the <hi>Blacks,</hi> far up within Land, and by them brought, and ſold to thoſe of <hi>Fantyn, Akanian, Adom, Akara,</hi> and other places, in Barter for <hi>European</hi> Wares; for few which live in theſe places, know the Mynes, nor hath any <hi>Whites</hi> ever been by, or near the ſame: For every particular King ſets ſecure Guards upon the Mynes within his Dominion, wherein he imploys his Slaves to work; and when he hath gotten a quantity together, he Trafficks for it with others, lying nearer the Shore; till by the paſſing through many hands, it at laſt arrives in the Trading Ships of the <hi>European</hi> Merchants.</p>

<note place="margin">How the Gold is taken up in the River.</note> eſpecially at the plentiful Gold-River <hi>Atzine,</hi> under the Cliffs and Water-falls, ſhooting down from the Mountains, Gold is taken up, in this manner: They Dive with a hollow Woodden Tray to the bottom, and rake there among the Earth, Stones, and all that they can come at; with which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving filled their Diſhes, they come up above Water, and waſhing the Maſs, find the Gold; for ſometimes whole pieces are waſh't down by force of the Water, through the Gold-Veins; whereof the King of <hi>Egwira</hi> hath a great many, which he keeps for his Fancy, aſcribing a ſecret Power and Vertue to it.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes they get by this Diving good ſtore of Gold, but otherwhiles in whole days make no advantage.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this Diving,
<note place="margin">In what manner the Gold is found.</note> Gold is found in divers other manners, <hi>viz.</hi> in pieces like Beans, or in Duſt as ſmall as Sand, or Filings of Copper; yet being very ragged, like broken Coral, or Stone, and intermingled with Grit, Clay, or Earth, which they cleanſe in the running Streams; yet not ſo, but that much Droſs remains among it.</p>
                     <p>Many hold opinion,

                     <p>The Men are of a middle Stature, free and airy of diſpoſition, well made,
<note place="margin">The Conſtitution of the Inhabitants.</note> ſtrong Limm'd, and ſwift of Foot, with round Faces, midling Lips, but flat or Camoſi'd Noſes, (with them a beauty) little Ears, white Eyes, with great Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows, and great Teeth, that ſhine, and are as white as Ivory, cauſed by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them with hard Wood, wherewith they keep them always very neat and clean. Their Viſages ſeem to ſhine with Sweat, or elſe foul'd with Dirt, Scurf and Naſtineſs; continuing Beardleſs till thirty years old: their Shoulders broad, Arms brawny, with great Hands and long Fingers, whereupon they let their Nails grow like Claws, ſometimes to the length of a Joynt, and as a great ornament, is eſpecially uſed among the Nobility. Laſtly, they have little Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, broad Feet, long Toes, and furniſh'd, as moſt of the <hi>Blacks</hi> upon the <hi>Guinee</hi> Coaſt, with large Propagators.</p>
                     <p>They have quick and ready Wits, to help in any ſudden emergency,
<note place="margin">Their Kind.</note> and ſhew themſelves withall very conſiderate, whereunto they adde great craft and ſubtlety. Covetouſneſs they learn from their Cradles, which makes them always craving, and with ſuch petulancy, as not to receive a denial. Courteous enough in outward appearance to Strangers, but envious, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to revenge amongſt one another; and where they can play the Maſters, fear not to manifeſt their Ambition, Treachery, domineering and ſupercilious Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>The People neighboring the Shore, both Men and Women,
<note place="margin">Expert in Swimming.</note> have great skill in Swimming; but the Men within Land uſe it ſo little, that they ſeem afraid at the ſight of any great River. They can keep long under Water, and Dive exceeding deep; wherefore the <hi>Portugals</hi> bring of the experteſt from hence to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> to uſe them in the Pearl-fiſhing in the Iſland <hi>Margaretta.</hi> Children not exceeding two years of Age betake themſelves inſtantly to the Water, and learn to Swim, becauſe unskilfulneſs therein is counted a great ſhame.</p>
                     <p>The Women are ſlender-Body'd, and cheerful of diſpoſition, but have ſuch great Breaſts, that they can fling them over their Shoulders, and give their Children Suck that hang at their backs.</p>
                     <p>They have great inclinations to Dancing;
<note place="margin">The Women are inclin'd to Dancing.</note> ſo that when they hear a Drum or other Inſtrument, they cannot ſtand quiet, but muſt ſhew their Skill. They meet uſually in the Evenings to Revel; while ſome Dance, others Play upon Inſtruments, as Copper Panns, ſtruck with Buttons, or Drums made of a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Tree, and cover'd over with a Goats Skin, or ſuch like barbarous Muſick. They Dance commonly two and two together,
<note place="margin">The uſe of Caſtinetto's came from <hi>Africa.</hi>
                        </note> Leaping and Stamping with their Feet, Snapping with their Fingers, and Bowing their Heads one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſome have Horſes Tails in their Hands, which they caſt one while upon one Shoulder, and one while upon the other; others with Wiſps of Straw in their hands, which they let fall, then again ſuddenly reaching it, they
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:56692:283"/>caſt it up aloft, and catch it in their hands. This Dancing having continu'd an hour, or an hour and a half, every one returns home. Beſides theſe Evening-Paſtimes, they have a ſort of Dancing-Schools, wherein the younger Breed are taught.</p>
                     <p>Theſe People are ſeldom free from Lice,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Blacks</hi> are Lowſie, though Clean.</note> and Fleas, although they keep themſelves clean in their Bodies, for they Waſh every Morning and Evening from Head to Foot, and anoint themſelves with Oyl of Palm, or Suet, to make them look Smooth, and that the Flies may not bite their Naked Body. The Women moreover anoint themſelves with Civet, and fine ſmelling Herbs, to be the more acceptable to their Husbands. They count it a great ſhame to Break Wind in the preſence of any: they never do their Eaſement upon the ground, but make a Hut, whereinto they retire, and when full, burn them to Aſhes. They cannot Evacuate their Water in a continu'd Current, as uſual in humane Creatures, but rather like Hoggs, by intermiſſive girdings.</p>
                     <p>When they meet any of their Friends or Acquaintance in the Morning,
<note place="margin">Their Salutation.</note> they Salute them with great Courteſie, Imbracing one the other in their Arms, and cloſing the two firſt Fingers of the Right Hand, ſnap two or three times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, each time bowing their Heads, and ſaying, <hi>Auzy, Auzy,</hi> that is, <hi>Good Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Good Morrow.</hi>

<note place="margin">Exquiſite in Stealing.</note> eſpecially from Foreigners, and among themſelves make boaſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as an ingenious piece of Subtilty; and ſo generally runs this vicious humor through the whole Race of <hi>Blacks,</hi> that great and rich Merchants do ſometimes practiſe ſmall Filching; for being come to the Trading Ships, they are not at reſt till they have taken away ſomething, though but Nails, or Lead, that is Nail'd to the outſide of the Ships to prevent Worm-eating: which no ſooner done, then with a ſingular ſleight of hand, they convey from one to another; but if they chance to be trapp'd, they all leap inſtantly over-Board for fear of Beating; but if caught, and ſoundly Baſtinado'd, then as paſt doubt of other puniſhment, they never avoid the Ship, but come again the next day to Trade.</p>
                     <p>They little eſteem any Promiſes made to Foreigners,
<note place="margin">They keep little of their Promiſes.</note> but break them if they can ſee any advantage in it; in brief, they are a treacherous, perjur'd, ſubtle, and falſe People, onely ſhewing Friendſhip to thoſe they have moſt need of. When they make a Promiſe or Oath to the <hi>Whites,</hi> they caſt their Face to the Ground; then bowing, ſpeak theſe words thrice, <hi>Jau, Jau, Jau,</hi> every time ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their hands together, and ſtamping upon the ground with their feet, and laſtly kiſs their <hi>Fetiſy,</hi> or <hi>Sants,</hi> which they wear upon their Legs, and Arms.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of their Food is Bread,
<note place="margin">Moſt of their Food is Bread.</note> by them call'd <hi>Kankaiens,</hi> Bak'd or Boil'd of <hi>Mille,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How it is made ready.</note> mix'd with Oyl of Palm, and ſometimes with green Herbs; the <hi>Mille</hi> they prepare by Pounding in a Stone-Mortar, afterwards cleanſe it in a Woodden Shovel; then the Women Grinde it every day twice upon a flat Stone, which ſtands a mans height from the Earth, with another Stone a Foot long, juſt as the Painters uſually Grind their Colours, which is no ſmall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, though little regarded by the men: Thus made into Meal, they mingle it with water, and make Cakes or Balls as big as both ones Fiſts, which they Boyl or Bake upon a hot Hearth, bound up in Cloth. Others add thereto <hi>Maizr.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Their daily Drink is Water and Palm-Wine;

                     </p>
                     <p>The Men Drink ſtoutly, eſpecially hot Liquors, ſuch as Palm-Wine,
<note place="margin">The Men are inclin'd to Drinking.</note> Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and other Wine, ſo that the Evening ſeldom ſees them Sober: In Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they uſe ſtrange Cuſtoms; for the firſt Drinker muſt lay his Hands upon his Head, and with a loud voyce cry out <hi>Tautoſi, Tautoſi:</hi> After Drinking they poure a little as an Oblation to their <hi>Fetiſi</hi> upon the Earth, crying aloud I. O. U. which if they omit, they are perſwaded it will do them no good, but vomit it up preſently.</p>
                     <p>Nor have they a leſs Voracity in Eating, being ſcarcely ſatisfi'd with Food;
<note place="margin">Gluttony in Eating.</note> their <hi>Caninus Appetitus</hi> being ſo inſatiate, that when they have as it were but newly ſwallow'd the laſt, they will fall to afreſh, as if pin'd for hunger: nor do they chew it like us, but take it in broken Gobbets with the three middle-Fingers,
<note place="margin">Unmannerly.</note> and throw them into their Mouthes down their Throat, without ever caſting it beſide.</p>
                     <p>¶ WAlled Cities they have none, nor good Towns near the Sea,
<note place="margin">Towns or Villages what they are.</note> onely upon the Shore ſome Villages appear, of no great conſequence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill-favoredly built, and worſe order'd; for they ſo ſtink of Dirt and Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſometimes when the Land-Wind blows, the Stench may be ſmell'd a mile and a half in the Sea. The Towns more within the Land are much bigger, and fuller of Trade, and People who live more at eaſe; for ſuch as live at the Sea, are Interpreters, Brokers, Rowers, Skippers, or Seamen, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Fiſhers, and Slaves of the other. But although, as we ſaid, the Towns lie open round about, and not incloſed; yet they are commonly built in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Defence: for they ſtand on high Hills, encompaſſed with Woods, and have no other comings to them, but through ſmall Paths, which are eaſily to be defended.</p>
                     <p>Their Houſes are very ſleight, and little better than Hog-Styes,
<note place="margin">Houſes.</note> or at the beſt like the Tents in Forts, or Bulwarks, being erected in the following form: Four Trees, or Poſts, to a Man's heighth, are ſet in a Square in the Earth,
<note place="margin">How they are made.</note> and next thoſe other Poſts laid and bound faſt; round about this Draft are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmall Sticks placed one by the other, and bound ſo cloſe together that they cannot put a hand between them, and Plaiſter'd from the top to the bottom with Loam of yellow Earth, to the thickneſs of almoſt half a Foot, which the heat of the Sun dries ſo hard as a Stone; within the Houſe, in ſtead of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Whitening, they lay another Stuff of red, white, or black Earth, which made thin with Water, they daub over with a Straw-wiſp,

<note place="margin">The Floor.</note> being made faſt with a cord or rope of <hi>Mille</hi>-ſtraw: The Floor compacted of Red-earth, laid very flat and even with a round hole in the middle, to ſet the Pot with Wine <hi>de Palm</hi> in, when they drink with one another. Commonly ſuch a Houſe is built in eight or ten days, and one may buy it for twenty Shillings, or little more. Three or four of theſe Huts always ſtand together in a ſquare, with a Yard in the middle, where the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men boyl their Meat, hedg'd about with Straw of <hi>Mille</hi> to the heighth of a Man.</p>

In the middle of his Court ſtands a ſquare Hut, open round about, but cover'd on the top, wherein he ſits in the day-time with his Nobility that come to ſpeak with him.

<note place="margin">Their Houſhold-ſtuffe.</note> bought of the <hi>Whites,</hi> wherein they Lock all they poſſeſs; ſo that little can be ſeen in their Houſes. They have ſome <hi>Kalabaſſes,</hi> which they call <hi>Akoffo,</hi> made of the Straw of <hi>Mille,</hi> wherein they commonly carry their Wares and other Goods to ſell. Their Arms, ſuch as Shields, Aſſagays, or Launces, hang on the Wall for Ornament. The remaining part of their Goods conſiſts in a Mat to ſleep on, two or three ſtumps of wood for Stools, a Pot or two to boyl in, two or three <hi>Kalabaſſes</hi> to drink Palm-Wine out of, and a great Kettle to waſh themſelves in.</p>
                     <p>Along the whole Coaſt the Inhabitants uſe light and nimble Boats,
<note place="margin">Canoos.</note> or Sloops; by them call'd, <hi>Ehem;</hi> by the <hi>Portugueſe, Almades;</hi> and by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and others, <hi>Canoos:</hi> with which they go ſome Leagues to Sea, and row up the Rivers from one place to another:
<note place="margin">How they are made.</note> They are made of one entire piece of Wood, or the body of a Tree cut long-ways with Cutting-Knives; then made hollow on the ſides, and narrow above, with a flat bottom, and without any covering over head; the Ends before and behind narrow, and cloſe together as a Hand-bow, and almoſt in the ſame faſhion; the Head ſomewhat lower, the Sides a finger thick, and the Bottom two: And after the hollowing, they burn the Wood with Straw, to prevent Worms, and cleaving by the Sun.</p>
                     <p>At each End the <hi>Canoo</hi> hath a Bowe like a Galley,
<note place="margin">The Shape.</note> a foot long, and a Knob a hand thick, whereby the <hi>Blacks</hi> carry them in and out of the Water upon their ſhoulders; for they ſuffer them not to lie ſoaking in the water, but ſet them upon Props to dry; by which means they both preſerve them from rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and make them more pliable and ſwift in the uſing. Behind they have a Rudder like an Oar, being a long Stick with a round leaf at it: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones,
<note place="margin">The Bigneſs.</note> wherewith they go out a Fiſhing, are generally ſixteen foot long, and one and a half, or two foot broad. Thoſe made for the Wars, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beaſts or other Wares, are five and thirty and forty foot long, five broad, and three foot high; ſome ſo large, that fifty or ſixty men may ſtand in them with their Arms; which ſort are made about <hi>Cape de tres Puntas,</hi> becauſe there grows mighty large Trees, being ſeventeen or eighteen fathom in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                     <p>Furthermore, for the prevention of Miſhaps, and as good <hi>Omens</hi> of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Voyage, they deck them with ſeveral Fancies and Conceits; as the Ears of <hi>Mille,</hi> and other painted Emblems and Devices.

                     </p>
                     <p>The men of all degrees go habited, either in Linnen,
<note place="margin">The Cloathing of the Men.</note> or Cotton Cloth girt round about their middle, and hanging down to their Knees.</p>
                     <p>They have a great fancy in Shaving their Hair,
<note place="margin">How their Hair is dreſt.</note> wherein they obſerve no particular faſhion; for one cuts it like a half-Moon, another Croſsways, the third with three or four Tufts; ſo that amongſt fifteen men, hardly two are alike.</p>
                     <p>They wear as an Ornament on their Arms, Rings of Ivory, ſtrip'd and ſtreak'd with Croſſes, three or four on one Arm, and about their Necks a String of <hi>Venetian</hi> Cryſtal, or Coral, which they break into pieces; but perſons of Eminency wear them commonly of Gold: As alſo on their Legs, Strings of ſmall Chriſtal, mix'd with Golden Studds, and other Ornaments of Gold. At their Feet they have commonly ſome Wiſps, or other ſtuff hanging, kept for their <hi>Sants</hi> which they call <hi>Fetiſies.</hi> On their Heads ſome wear Caps made of the Peeling of Trees, with a long Tail ty'd to it, in ſtead of a Hat-band, dy'd and drawn with ſeveral Colours. Others have Caps or Hats of Sedge or Reeds; a third, Hats with broad Brims, Woven of green Bulruſhes; a fourth, made of Dogs-skins, and <hi>Cabriets</hi> or Sheep-skins.</p>
                     <p>The Women go Apparell'd in Linnen for the moſt part, faſten'd or ty'd cloſe under their Breaſts, ſomewhat above the middle, and reaching to the Knees with a Girdle of a hand-breadth, Red, Blew, or Yellow, to which hang their Knives, Purſes, and Keys for an Ornament; beſides many Taſſels of their <hi>Sants</hi> or <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus they go Cloth'd in the houſe, but when they walk abroad, they lay off this Garment, and waſhing their Bodies from top to Toe, put on a longer, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down to their Feet like a Petticoat, over which, as the former, girt cloſe, being Mantlewiſe, they throw another of Say, or other ſuch thin Stuff.</p>
                     <p>Their Heads are finely dreſt, and their Hair neatly Plaited,
<note place="margin">The Head-gear of the Women.</note> in the midſt with a Tuft, trim'd round about with Strings, anointed with Oyl of Palm; in their Hair they have uſually long ſlender <hi>Kammeties</hi> or Bodkins, with two Teeth, about the length of a Finger, with which they thruſt in their Hair, when any thing troubles them; alſo in Salutation they draw theſe Bodkins out of their Heads,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:56692:286"/>and ſtick them in again. Upon their Foreheads they have three or four Cuts, about the length of the firſt Joynt of a Finger; ſo alſo on their Cheeks, which being ſwell'd up, they Paint with ſeveral Colours: Beneath their Brows, they make white Strokes, and ſtick their Faces full of white Spots, which at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeem like Pearls. They hang in their Ears Braſs and Tin Rings, and put on their Arms, Copper and Ivory Armlets; and on their Legs Rings of Copper. Young unmarri'd Maids wear many ſmall Iron wreath'd Rings on one Arm.</p>
                     <p>But the chiefeſt Pride conſiſts in their Shining Teeth, which they pick and rub with a certain piece of Wood, till they become as ſmooth, clean, and white, as poliſh'd Ivory.</p>
                     <p>The People lying near the Shore,
<note place="margin">Their Employment.</note> maintain themſelves either by Fiſhing, Boiling of Salt, Tilling of Land, or Merchandiſe; as alſo, by being Factors and Interpreters to thoſe which come out of the Countrey with Gold, to Trade upon the Coaſts with the <hi>Whites;</hi> but the Inland, ſome by Husbandry, others by Trading, many by Plaiting Caps of Bulruſhes, or Dogs or <hi>Kabriten</hi> skins. Others Weave Caps, Purſes, and Garments of the Peeling of Trees, Painted with all ſorts of Colours, and very Artificially made, as though Woven of Flax or Hemp.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Atzyn, Ante, Guaffo, Terra Pekine,</hi> and <hi>Cabo Cors,</hi> maintain themſelves by Fiſhing: Thoſe of <hi>Little-Inkaſsia,</hi> by Husbandry and Burning of Lime.</p>
                     <p>They of <hi>Labbede,</hi> though lying near the Sea, make their beſt livelyhood by keeping of Cattel, and making of Salt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Blacks</hi> of the Town <hi>Moure,</hi> uſe the Fiſhing Trade, but the chiefeſt help they have is Merchandize, and to entertain the <hi>Akaniſts,</hi> which come to them with Gold.</p>
                     <p>The People of <hi>Sabou,</hi> as moſt of the Inlanders, beſtow their whole time and labour in Tilling and Manuring their Fields, whereby in the Town <hi>Moure,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Sea-Coaſt, in the Kingdom of <hi>Sabou,</hi> Proviſion of <hi>Mille, Injam's,</hi> Fruit, Hens and other things, may be had cheaper than in any other place of the Gold-Coaſt.</p>
                     <p>Their manner of Tillage proves very laborious,
<note place="margin">How the Lands are Till'd.</note> being done by the hand, without help either of Horſes or Oxen; and beſides, they are forc'd to clear the Land of Wood, which cut down to ground, the Stumps and Roots they burn to Aſhes, which ſerve them in ſtead of Marl, or Dunging.</p>
                     <p>The Seed-time,
<note place="margin">Seed-time.</note> with them begins commonly on the twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> in the Rainy-Seaſon, when the Soyl is moiſtned and become ſoft; then every man with his whole Family goes into the Field, and takes his beſt Cloathes and Jewels with him,
<note place="margin">They are greatly buſied.</note> wherewith he adorns his Wife, Children, and Slaves; giving them alſo plenty of Victuals, with Wine of Palm; in the Evening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, follow'd by his Retinue, Singing and Dancing.</p>

                     <p>In <hi>Sama</hi> the <hi>Portugals</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have a Factory, and Trade with the People of <hi>Adom</hi> and <hi>Waſſa</hi> for the ſame Wares that were wont to be Vented at <hi>Ante, viz.</hi> Iron, Says, Courſe Linnen, Seamens Knives, Beads, old Sheets, and ſuch like.</p>

                     <p>Moſt of their Cheats they practice in their Gilded Arm-Rings, which they mix with Copper, as likewiſe among other pieces of Gold, and cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from the Gold, when newly Clipt, but grow commonly Ruſty and Pale, having lay'n ſome time amongſt the Gold: the beſt proof they make by Strong-Waters.</p>
                     <p>Their melted Gold (which Art of Melting they have learn'd from the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>) they falſifie with two much red Copper, or Silver mixt amongſt it; for without one of theſe two the Gold will not Run. This is a Cheat very common and uſual among thoſe of <hi>Fantyn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have yet another Trick, to cover Silver and red Copper over with Gold, ſo as not to be diſcover'd unleſs you cut it.</p>
                     <p>Formerly the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> us'd to puniſh the <hi>Blacks</hi> very ſeverely, if they brought but one Peny-weight of falſifi'd Gold to ſell, without any reſpect of Perſons.</p>
                     <p>The Gold as it comes out of the Myne, without Melting or Refining, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the beſt, that is, when the Sand, or Duſt is meerly Sifted out: Beſides, one Myne affords much better Gold than another; for the deeper they fetch up the Gold, the worſe it proves, being ſpoil'd by too much Quick-Silver.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the Gold brought from the upper Places of this Coaſt, that of <hi>Atzyn</hi> and <hi>Adom</hi> bears the Credit as the beſt, becauſe 'tis obſerv'd, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Melt it without falſifying.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Akaniſts</hi> bring moſt melted Gold, which is taken for good; but they muſt be narrowly inſpected, for they are ingenious at Gilding.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Akaras</hi> Gold hath a good repute for Purity,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Akaras</hi> Gold is the beſt.</note> if the Duſt the quite blown from it.</p>

This invention the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> taught them firſt; for before their arrival the <hi>Blacks</hi> knew nothing of them: but they finding neither Coyn, nor any ſmall Weight of Gold for to pay, when they bought Fruit, or any other Proviſion, thought on this way of Payment in ſtead of ſingle Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: ſince which time, all along the Coaſt, an infinite number of theſe Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may had; when the other <hi>Blacks,</hi> where the <hi>Whites</hi> are not known, uſe no ſuch, but ſell their Gold as it comes from the Earth: for in ſtead of Coyn or Money to pay one another in ſmall Sums, the People of <hi>Akara</hi> have little Iron Spikes, or Croſſes of a Finger long, with a Half-Moon on the top.</p>

<note place="margin">Arms.</note> and whole Bodies, with yellow, white, and red Colours, and make upon it Croſſes, Snakes, and ſuch like, hanging a round Ring, made of the Branches of Trees, as thick as an Arm, about their Neck in ſtead of a Corſlet, to keep off the blows of their Cutting-Knives, and ſet on their Heads Caps like a Helmet, made of Crocodiles, or Leopards-Skins, adorn'd with red Parrots Feathers, and before with two or four Horns. The Grandees wear a Garland of Elephants, or Sea-Horſes Teeth: About their Bodies they have a Leathern Girdle, that comes betwixt their Legs, with a ſmall Cloth before their Privacies; and in the Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle they ſtick a Knife, or Ponyard, whoſe Sheaths are made of Dogs, or Buck-Skins, adorn'd with a great red Shell of a Hand breadth on the top. The common Soldiers uſe great Chopping-Knives, broad at the ends, and ſmall; and in ſtead of a Handle they adorn it with a Bone of an Ape or Tyger, which they ſtick at one ſide of their Girdle.</p>
                     <p>Their other Arms are Darts, Shields, <hi>Aſſagays,</hi> or Lances, and two-edged Swords, with Handles of the Bones of Lions, Tygers, and other dangerous Beaſts, Knobb'd at the ends, and cover'd with a Plate of Gold, or with Skins of Fiſh. Their <hi>Aſſagays,</hi> or Lances, Darts, Arrows, and Bowes, have ſeveral other faſhions; but moſtare Tipt at both ends, with Iron of an equal weight, that in the throwing, they may flie level.</p>
                     <p>Their Shields are commonly ſix Foot long, and four broad, made of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, or Wood, in manner of a four ſquare Tray, bow'd inward, having in the midſt a Wooden, Iron, or Copper Croſs, which they hold by. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of State, cover their Shields with Tygers Skins, and put an Iron or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Plate above that, two Foot long, and one broad. The Bowes are of ſtreight, hard, and tough Wood, and the Strings made of the Peeling of Trees; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, at one end, in ſtead of Feathers, have a rough Dogs Skin drawn half over them; and at the other, a ſmall Head Poyſon'd: but they may not carry ſuch Poyſon'd Arrows, except in the Wars againſt their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>Their Drums are of two ſorts, one made of hollow Trees,
<note place="margin">Drums.</note> drawn over with a Goats Skin, being very deep; whereupon with Drum-Sticks, like Peſtels, they Beat when the King keeps a Feaſt, for they lie commonly before the Kings, or Captains houſe. The others made alſo of hollow Trees, but ſmaller, round above, and ſharp beneath like a Top, which they hang about their Necks; and therewith, after their attendance is ended, they go about Drumming; which they uſe to none but the Nobility.</p>

They never fight but with continual Drumming, and Sounding the Horn. The Priſoners on both ſides they make Slaves, and Feaſt in ſome places upon the Slain, making Drinking-Cups of their Skulls.</p>
                     <p>In Drawing out to Fight they keep no Order,
<note place="margin">They fight without order.</note> but all run together, falling on furiouſly, with great Cries and Shreekings; in which Service all are bound to follow the King, ſaving onely, very old Men, and Youths under eighteen or twenty years of Age.</p>

Now it is to be obſerv'd, that by three Gifts,
<note place="margin">How they are made.</note> any man may attain to the degree of Nobility; that is, of a Dog, a Sheep, and a Cow, together with ſome other things of leſs conſequence; as Wine of Palm, and Brandy Wine: ſo that this Honour, <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> coſts them near a Hundred Markes, and diſtributed in this manner: Firſt he buys for thoſe that undertake to recommend his cauſe to the <hi>Braffo,</hi> or Captain of the Town, a Cow, whereto all the Nobility are invited, and without fail appear at the ſet-time, Dreſt in the beſt Attire, to help to order the Feaſt, and to ſhew Feats of Activity and Mirth. In the mean time, the new Nobleman having made all ready to entertain his Gueſts, ſends to another <hi>Fidalgo,</hi> a Hen, and a Pot of <hi>Palmito</hi>-Wine to his houſe. On the Feaſt-day, all the Inhabitants of the Town come together, and go to the upper end of the Market, provided with all ſorts of playing Inſtruments for their Sports; as Drums, Horns, Bells, and other deviſes, to whom the <hi>Braffo</hi> joyns, accompany'd with many Youths Arm'd with Shields and Spears, or Lances; and their Faces Painted with Red and Yellow Oker.</p>
                     <p>At laſt comes the new made <hi>Fidalgo,</hi> into the company of the other Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with a young Man Attendant, carrying a Stool after him, upon which he ſeats himſelf; when preſently his Fellows wiſh him good luck, pulling a handful of Straw out of the Roof, and lay under his Feet; then addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:56692:289"/>to tender their Civilities to his Wife, tying up her Hair with many Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Fetiſsies,</hi> and Croſſes, having about her Neck a Gold Chain; and putting in one of her hands a Horſes Tail, and on the right Arm a Gold Ring, with a broad <hi>Pendulum</hi> of Gold, like a Potlid: thus Attir'd and Attended with many other Women, they follow the beforemention'd Cow through the Market, Singing and Dancing, till return'd into the ſame place; the Men make ſtrange Sport, Drumming, Dancing, Fencing, Singing and Leaping about them: At laſt they carry them through the Town upon a Stool, caſting Meal in their Faces; thus their exorbitant Paſtimes continue till Evening, and then the other Nobles conduct them to their uſual Habitations.</p>
                     <p>The next day, (for this Solemnity continues three) they ſpend as the former.</p>
                     <p>On the third, the Executioner Slaughters the Cow, and cuts it into four Quarters, of which every one has a piece given; but the Inſtituters of the Feaſt may not Eat thereof, as conceited, that if they did, they ſhould die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Year.</p>
                     <p>During the Feaſt a white Flag ſtands upon his Houſe in token of Joy, and an open Court; and after the Solemnity ended, the Head of the Cow is brought to his Houſe, Painted with many Colours, and hang'd about with Wiſps of Straw, and Devices, in token or confirmation of his Nobility; whereby he hath gain'd great Freedom and Priviledges: for now he may buy Slaves, and Trade for other things, which before he had no permiſſion to do. They take great care therefore about it, although perhaps the acquiring coſt them all they are worth, and thereby are much poorer than before: but he ſoon gets it up again by Preſents brought him from others, each according to his ability. And now as ſoon as he hath gain'd an Eſtate again, he beſtows it upon Slaves, wherein their Riches and Reputation conſiſts.</p>
                     <p>Theſe keep one among another a yearly time of Feaſting; where they make good Cheer, new Paint the Cows Head, and hang it about with Ears of <hi>Mille.</hi> Beſides this, the Nobility in general keep one Feaſt upon the ſixth day of <hi>July;</hi> where they Paint their Bodies with Stripes of red Earth, and wear on their Necks a Garland of green Boughs and Straw, as a Badge of their Nobility. In the Evening they all come as Gueſts to the Houſe of the <hi>Braffo;</hi> where they are entertain'd with exceeding Mirth and Feaſting, even to Exceſs and Drunkenneſs.</p>
                     <p>Theſe People are ſo conceited of their old Idolatrous Cuſtoms,
<note place="margin">Religion, or Worſhip.</note> that they deride, as it were, the Religion of the <hi>Whites,</hi> under what Name or Notion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

                     <note place="margin">Their Maintenance.</note> and of all the other Towns lying near the Sea, maintain themſelves partly by Fiſhing and making of Salt, and partly by Merchandiſe, but within the Countrey by Tillage onely.</p>
                  <p>The Method of their Husbandry and Solemnity of their Seed-time,
<note place="margin">Tillage.</note> is the ſame with that we deſcribed of the <hi>Gold-Coaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Village <hi>Ba,</hi> every four days they have a free Market of Salt,
<note place="margin">Merchandiſe.</note> brought from <hi>Jojo</hi> in great quantities by <hi>Canoos,</hi> and from thence carri'd to the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Ulkuma,</hi> where 'tis ready Barter.</p>
                  <p>Four or five Miles from <hi>Ba,</hi> by a great Tree, a free Market is kept every day, where the Inhabitants, ſometimes to the number of three or four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, come with all ſorts of Commodities.</p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:56692:292"/>
                  <p>When the Merchants Land at <hi>Arder,</hi> they are brought to the King, where they muſt give an account of their Trading to him in the <hi>Portugal</hi> Tongue: for none may Trade there before he hath firſt offer'd his Goods to the King, that, as he ſays, his Subjects might not have the beſt Merchandiſe, and he the courſe; beſides this, they muſt give to the King for a Preſent, a Lump of fine Coral, ſix Pieces of Cypreſs Cloathes, three of <hi>Mauriſſes,</hi> and one of Diaper: yet nevertheleſs the <hi>Whites</hi> muſt ſeem to ſet out the beſt Wares, as Silk, and the like, uppermoſt; though generally they conceal better, becauſe then the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects muſt have the worſt onely; which would not be for the Merchants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: however, as we ſaid, they muſt ſeem to correſpond.</p>
                  <p>After the delivery of the Silk Wares, and ſome other ſleighter, yet in the King's Court ſeveral Preſents muſt be given to his Son; to the <hi>Foella,</hi> or Captain of the <hi>Whites;</hi> to the Porters, or Door-keepers; and to divers other of the Courtiers.</p>
                  <p>After leave obtain'd from the King to Trade, all the Nobility conduct the <hi>Whites</hi> off to the Stock-fiſh Town, lying a Mile from the South-Weſt Shore, where a convenient place is appointed for them to Truck for Slaves.</p>
                  <p>But for liberty to Trade for <hi>Akory</hi> they muſt pay more, forty Pieces of yellow Armlets, twenty Hens, a <hi>Cabriet,</hi> or Sheep, beſides other things to thoſe that make Proclamation, that every one that will Trade with the <hi>Whites,</hi> may now do it freely.</p>
                  <p>The Wages for carrying the Merchandiſe to the King, is two yellow Rings, for a Cheſt or Pack carri'd by two Men; and four, for what four Men carry.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as they come to Land, there muſt be ſomething given to the <hi>Honga,</hi> or Captain of the Boat; for which he muſt be ready at all times with his Boat on the Shore for fear of any miſhap, to preſerve Goods and People; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the beating of the Sea againſt the Shore, the Landing proves very dangerous.</p>
                  <p>When the Merchants have done, and are ready to depart, they muſt pay to the King two Muſquets, and five and twenty Pound of Gun-Powder, or for want of that, in Silk-Worms, the worth of nine Slaves; to the <hi>Carte,</hi> to the <hi>Foello,</hi> or Captain of the <hi>Whites,</hi> and to <hi>Honga</hi> the Captain of the Boat, to each of them a like Preſent.</p>
                  <p>Proviſions for the <hi>Whites</hi> may be had here for a reaſonable Price, that is, a Cask of freſh Water, and a Sag of Wood, for two yellow Armlets; a Kof, or Cheſt of Salt, for three; five Hens, for four; a Pot of Beer, for one.</p>
                  <p>In time of Wars none are exempted from Service,
<note place="margin">The Wars.</note> but very old Men and Children; their diſorderly manner of Fight you have before deſcrib'd, as alſo their Barbariſm to the Slain and Priſoners, and Method of Triumphing with their Heads; and therefore we will not here repeat, and cloy you with the ſame things again.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Arder</hi> hath abſolute and Soveraign Power over his Subjects,
<note place="margin">Dominion.</note> and according as they reckon State, carries a Majeſtick Splendor, both in Clothes and Servants, his Subjects tendring him great reſpect: He Creates Noblemen and Courtiers at his pleaſure, and puniſhes Offenders, not any daring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict.</p>
                  <p>Every Town, as <hi>Jakkijn</hi> and <hi>Ba,</hi> hath their <hi>Fidalgos</hi> or Noblemen to preſide it, in the King's Name, who exacts a great Revenue from the Inhabitants, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the King.</p>

                  <p>The Crown deſcends to the Eldeſt or Youngeſt Son, after their Fathers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, and takes all his Father left, but his Wives, whom all but his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whom extraordinary reſpect is ſhown, he imploys in his works of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds.</p>
                  <p>The Goods of the meaneſt ſort, after their deceaſe, falls to the Noblemen, whoſe Vaſſals they were.</p>
                  <p>Their Religion conſiſts in no appointed Meetings, or ſetled Form,
<note place="margin">Their Religion.</note> though they have <hi>Fetiſeros</hi> or Prieſts; for every Perſon of Quality hath his own Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and if any be ſick in their Family, the <hi>Fetiſero</hi> comes, and taking Oxen,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fetiſero's,</hi> or Prieſts.</note> Sheep, and Hens for a Sacrifice, cuts their Throats, and with the Bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkles their <hi>Fetiſi</hi> or <hi>Sant,</hi> that is, ſometimes no more than an old Earthen Pot, or Basket.</p>
                  <p>Every Family hath a Meeting once in ſix moneths, at which, their Prieſt offers Sacrifice to their <hi>Fetiſi</hi> or <hi>Sant,</hi> put under a Pot with Holes; and then they enquire of what they deſire to know: If the <hi>Fetiſi</hi> be unſatisfied, the Prieſt can get no words from him; if otherwiſe, he hath an anſwer by a gracile, or ſmall-piped voice, (as if it came from the <hi>Fetiſi,</hi> whereas, indeed it is a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited ſound by their Prieſts:) Then the Inquirer takes a Baſon, fill'd with Beer and Meal, and gives to the Prieſt; then ſuddenly, ſomewhat in the Pot, under which the <hi>Fetiſi</hi> ſits, leaps; whereupon all promiſing obedience to the anſwer, and drinking a draught out of the Baſon, depart.</p>
                  <p>They believe another life after this, but not for all; for they ſay, that a man after death, periſheth, and his bloud congeals; ſo that none muſt expect any Reſurrection, ſaving thoſe that are ſlain in the Wars, which they averre to have found by experience; and that the Bodies ſlain in the Wars, lie not two days in the Graves. But more probably, this ſeems a cheat of their <hi>Fetiſero's,</hi> who in the night, ſteal the bodies from their reſting-places, to make the people believe they were riſen, and gone to another life; and to this end, to make them the more ſtout and valiant in the Wars.</p>

                     <p>The Women have a blue Cloth from the middle, reaching below the Knee,
<note place="margin">Clothing.</note> and ſome ſmall covering over their Breaſts; their Hair neatly ty'd up, and
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:56692:296"/>Pleited on the Crown of the Head like a Garland, the one half of a black, the other of a red colour, with Braſs Rings on their Arms.</p>
                     <p>No man may go Clothed to, or in the Court, unleſs the King appoint him his Habit; inſomuch that there are Men in the Palace of twenty, or twenty four years of Age, who go ſtark naked, without any ſign of ſhame, onely with a Chain of fine Coral or Jaſper about their Necks. But when the King gives them Garments, and together with them a Wife, ever after they always go Cloathed, and waſh their Hair, which never grows to ſuch length as to need cutting. Neither may the Women put on any Cloathes, till given by her Husband; ſo that Women of twenty, and five and twenty years old run along the Streets ſtark naked without ſhame or rebuke: but when the Husband hath once Suited her, he cauſes a Houſe to be made for her, and ſleeps by her, as by his other Wives.</p>
                     <p>Every Man Marries as many Women as he deſires,
<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> yet keeps beſides a great number of Concubines: But a <hi>White</hi> or a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> may not be permitted to keep a Girl, becauſe forbidden on pain of Death.</p>
                     <p>The Woman that hath had a Son by her deceaſed Husband,
<note place="margin">A Widow is a Woman-Servant to her Son.</note> may not Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry again, but muſt be a Slave to her Son. Now if it happen, that any Man have a mind to ſuch a Widow, he ſues to the Son for her, promiſing to give him another young Maid in her ſtead, which muſt continue his Slaveſs as long as he pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>If the Parents beſtow not their Daughter in Marriage before twelve or fourteen years of Age, after that time they have nothing more to do with her.</p>
                     <p>All the Women that after the death of the Husband admit another into their private Embraces, fall to the King, whom he beſtows in Marriage; but ſuch as keep themſelves more reſerv'd, the Son claims, and beſtows upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, as we have ſaid already.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the King doth not beſtow theſe Women in Marriage again, but makes <hi>Regetairs,</hi> or Nurſes of them. Theſe, conſidering they need not ſtand in fear of a Husband, chuſe as many ſingle Men as they like, to whom they proſtitute themſelves at pleaſure: and when any of them prove with Child, and bear a Son, they are free from paying of Tribute; but if they have a Girl, it becomes the King's due to diſpoſe of.</p>
                     <p>There are great <hi>Regetairs,</hi> to whom the inferior give a yearly account, as they again to the great <hi>Fiadores,</hi> or Treaſurers of the Empire, who declare the ſame to the King onely.</p>
                     <p>No Man may ſleep with his Wife when ſhe hath lay'n in Childbed, before the Child is a year and a half old: but ſhe knows well enough how to play her Game in the mean time with others; of which if the Husband get any knowledge, he complains to the <hi>Fiadoors.</hi>

                     <p>There are no Twins found,
<note place="margin">Why there are no Twins.</note> though likely enough that ſome are born; yet conceal'd with all care poſſible by the Midwife, becauſe they count the bearing of two Children at a Birth, a great ſhame to a Woman.</p>

When a Woman dies, her Friends take Pots, Pans, Cheſts, and Boxes, and go with them upon their Heads along the Streets, with the ſound of Drums and other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:56692:296"/>Singing to the honour of the Deceaſed. And according to her Degree and State, kill at the Grave ſome Slaves, and ſet near the Corps; ſo that no perſon of ability dies there, but the Funeral is attended with much expence of humane Blood.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Inheritance,
<note place="margin">Inheritance.</note> the Husband takes all the Goods the Wife leaves behind her, except what ſhe hath given her Children, while living; whereas the Woman may not, after the deceaſe of her Husband, take the leaſt part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they all, as well Wives, Slaves, as other Goods, fall to the King; who for the moſt part, if there be a Son, beſtows them on him.</p>
                     <p>No Foreigners can Trade up the River of <hi>Benyn</hi> without Order of the King; who chuſes one <hi>Fiadoor,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Merchandiſe.</note> or Councellor of the Kingdom to Treat and Trade with them: Neither may thoſe appointed for the Trade, ſo much as converſe with the <hi>Whites,</hi> or come into their Store-houſes, much leſs buy any <hi>European</hi> Wares, but are conſtrain'd to take them at the deareſt rate of the <hi>Fia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors.</hi> On the other ſide, no <hi>Fiadoor,</hi> or Steward, may deal for any thing that belongeth to the Wars; ſo that every one muſt keep himſelf within the bounds of his Office.</p>

                     <p>All Differences ariſing about Trade, the Nobility decide; for the Judges of the Place meddle not, ſo long as any remain there that belong to the King.</p>
                     <p>Their Arms are Shields,
<note place="margin">Arms, or Weapons.</note> Spears, Bowes, Lances, or <hi>Aſſagays,</hi> and empoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd Arrows, which the <hi>Fetiſero's,</hi> or <hi>Devil-Hunters,</hi> prepare very artificially. The Nobility, when they go to the Wars, Cloathe themſelves in Scarlet, as a Badge of Eminency; others have Gorgets of Elephants and Leopard-Teeth, and high red Caps, Wrought and Quilted with Leopards and Civet-Cat Skins; unto which hangs a long Horſe Tail for Ornament.</p>
                     <p>The common Soldiers uſually go with the upper part of their Body naked, but on the lower wear a Cloth as fine as Silk.</p>
                     <p>In Fighting they keep a good Diſcipline and Order, for none may ſtir from his Place, though he ſee Death inevitable before his Eyes. None participate of the Booty but the General, or Field-Martial, by them call'd <hi>Owe-Aſerry,</hi> or <hi>Siaſſeere:</hi> and yet every one thanks the King, that he will account them worthy of Employment, and deign to ſend them to the Wars for him. What Arrows remain after the Battel unſhot, they lay up in ſeveral Chambers in the King's Armory, and preſently make as many new again; which poyſon'd by the <hi>Feti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſero's,</hi> become uſeful for further Service.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For the more orderly Government of the Kingdom, he makes three chief Counſellors in <hi>Great Benyn,</hi> call'd by the <hi>Portugueſe, Figdares;</hi> who manage the Affairs of the whole Countrey under the King, (beſides whom none ſuperior to them but the Field-Martial, and the King's Mother:) Theſe have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over every Corner and Quarter of the City, and draw great Profit from thence: their Names of Office being <hi>Ongogue, Oſſade,</hi> and <hi>Arribo.</hi>

But the Judges oftentimes, though unknown to the King, yet not without the connivance of ſome of the greateſt <hi>Fiadoors,</hi> are Brib'd to partiality.</p>
                     <p>The preſent King keeps a thouſand Wives;
<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Benyn</hi> keeps many Wives.</note> for by the Death of his Father <hi>Kambadie,</hi> ſuch Women as had been taken up for his uſe, but never known by him, became his Sons by Inheritance: the reſt, with whom the Father had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly converſed, may never Marry again, but are ſhut up together in a Cloyſter, and kept by <hi>Eunuchs.</hi>

                     <p>This Prince makes great Wars againſt his Neighbors towards the Eaſt and North, winning from them many Cities and Towns,
<note place="margin">He makes great Wars.</note> and thereby enriching his Treaſury, with great Booty of Jaſper-Stones, and other things.</p>
                     <p>He keeps ſuch a reſerv'd State,
<note place="margin">Comes but once a year out of his Court.</note> that he appears but once a year at the chief Feſtival out of his Court, before the Commons, and then on Horſeback, adorn'd with all ſorts of Royal Ornaments, and attended with three or four hundred Noble-men, both on Horſeback and on Foot, and many Muſitians before and after, in that manner as is mention'd in the foregoing Deſcription

As an Ornament to this ſhort Cavalcade, he expoſes to ſight ſome tame Leopards Chain'd, which he keeps for his Recreation, many Dwarfs and Fools, to ſhew mimick Tricks, and antick Poſtures, and make Paſtime for the People.</p>
                     <p>At this Feſtival, ten, twelve, thirteen, or more Slaves, for the honour of the King, are put to death; which they believe, after they have been a while dead, are going to another Countrey, and there reviving, enjoy the greateſt felicity imaginable.</p>
                     <p>Upon another Day the King ſheweth his Riches, conſiſting in Jaſper-Stone, Coral, and other Commodities, before all Men, hanging out to publick view; and then he beſtows many Preſents of Slaves, Women, and other things, on the well-deſerving: And alſo confers on his Favorites many Offices, which concern the Government of Cities and Towns.</p>
                     <p>The King's Mother,

<note place="margin">The Funeral of the King.</note> a great Cave is digg'd in his Court, broad below, and narrow above, and ſo deep, that the Diggers muſt be drown'd in the Water.</p>
                     <p>In this Cave they put the Corps, and then all his Favorites and Servants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to accompany and ſerve him in the other Life; and when they are gone down to the Corps in the Cave, they ſet a great Stone over the Mouth, the People that day and night ſtanding round about it.</p>
                     <p>The next day ſome go to the Cave, and removing the Stone, ask them within, <hi>What they do?</hi> and, <hi>If none be gone to ſerve the King?</hi> To which then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps nothing elſe is anſwer'd but <hi>No.</hi>

                     <p>At length, after four or five, or more days, the Men dead, and none left to give anſwer, they give account thereof to the new eſtabliſh'd King; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently makes a great Fire over the Cave, whereat ſpending a great quantity of Fleſh to give away to the Common-People, ſo ſolemnizeth his Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Some hold opinion, that into the foremention'd Cave, no living, but onely the Trunks of beheaded Men are put; as alſo that they throw in great part of his Royal Veſture, Houſhold-ſtuff, and other Wealth.</p>
                     <p>By the King's Order yearly Feſtivals are kept,
<note place="margin">The Feſtival time of the deceaſed King.</note> in Commemoration of the deceaſed Kings; wherein they make horrible Sacrifices of Men and Beaſts, to the number of four or five hundred; but never more than three and twenty in a day: moſt of them Malefactors, who have deſerv'd Death, and reſerv'd in the Trunk of a Tree for this Time. But if it happen that there be not Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors enough, then the King, to compleat the number, ſends for ſome of his
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:56692:298"/>Servants in the Evening into the Streets, to take all thoſe that go without Lights, and bring them into the Priſon. If the ſurpriſed be a poor, or idle perſon, he muſt expect no favor, but hurri'd to Priſon, ſoon receives his doom; but a rich Man may redeem himſelf. The greateſt <hi>Fiadoors</hi> cannot excuſe their Slaves from this duty but by another. And in this manner, the <hi>Fetiſero's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make a humane Sacrifice to the Devil, gets a Man by order from the Court, which they may diſpoſe of as they pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>The Crown deſcends to the Sons, and for want of Sons, to the Brothers.</p>
                     <p>When the King lieth upon his Death-bed, he ſends for one of his Nobility,
<note place="margin">The Inheritance.</note> whom they call <hi>Onegwa;</hi> to whom he declares the right of Succeſſion, and who ſhall be his Heir; which this Noble-man does reveal to none, till a competent time after the King's Death; but then takes upon him the overſight of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed King's Goods and Children, who come with great humility and Salute him, not as yet knowing who ſhall Inherit the Crown. Every one makes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to this <hi>Onegwa</hi> with great reſpect, in hopes of future advantage, but he continues ſilent till the appointed time; when ſending for the <hi>Owe-Aſſerry,</hi> that is, the General, tells him which Son the deceaſed King appointed to Inherit the Crown: whereupon the General, without ſpeaking a word, withdraws to his Houſe; and the <hi>Onegwa</hi> ſets up that Son to be King; whereof the retir'd Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral receiving notice, after five or ſix days, he comes again to the Court, and calling for the <hi>Onegwa,</hi> demands if that were the old King's will; wherein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an affirmative ſatisfaction, immediately they preſent the depoſited In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Crown, and he receives the Dominion; whereupon, after thanks return'd, he puts on Royal Robes, and ſits down. Then come all the Vaſſals, from the higheſt to the loweſt, and do homage upon their Knees.</p>
                     <p>This Solemnity ended, the King retires to another Town, call'd <hi>Goſeboe,</hi>

<note place="margin">The new King kills all his Brethren.</note> endeavours to cut off all his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to ſecure himſelf againſt Competitors: of late ſome of them have been ſpared; but they made ſuch ill uſe of that favor, by confederating with the Friends of ſome condemn'd and baniſh'd <hi>Fiadoors,</hi> that this preſent King ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, and other ways put to death all his Brethren, not clandeſtinely, but upon publick notice: though ſome ſtick not to report, that he forc'd them to hang themſelves, becauſe none may lay hands on the Royal Bloud to kill them; yet after their Death he order'd them to be hang'd with great Magnificence and State.</p>
                     <p>Their Religion, if any, conſiſteth in honouring the Devil, to whom,
<note place="margin">Religion.</note> as we ſaid before, they ſacrifice Men and Beaſts: for though they well know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there is a God, who hath created Heaven and Earth, and ſtill Rules, yet they eſteem it unneceſſary to Pray to, or Serve him, becauſe he is not evil, but good; but they ſeek to appeaſe the Devilwith Sacrifices, for that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proſecutes them with evil. They call God, <hi>Oriſa;</hi> and the <hi>Whites, Owioriſa,</hi> that is, <hi>God's Child.</hi> They have wooden <hi>Fetiſies,</hi> or Idols, which they Worſhip; and <hi>Fetiſero's,</hi> or Prieſts, who enquire of, and receive anſwers from the Devil.

                  <p>Though the People claim a kind of propriety in Wives, yet is it ſuch as merits not to be brought under the name of Marriage, not for that they take as many as they can, but becauſe when any Friend comes to viſit the Husband, he immediately, as a mark of amity, proſtitutes one of his Wives to him. And in all other Caſes gives ſuch liberty, that Women taken in Adultery, receive commendations and rewards, rather than obloquy and puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>A Man, when firſt Married, gets not eſteem nor regard among the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Friends, till he hath ſmartly beaten and boxed his Wife; and thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward they reckon him one of that Family: And this uſage hath by cuſtom become ſo naturaliz'd, that a Woman ſuſpects her Husbands Love, unleſs he frequently beat her.</p>

                  <p>This Countrey of <hi>Lovango</hi> affords divers ſorts of Fruit,
<note place="margin">Plants.</note> 
                     <hi>viz. Maſſa-Mamponta,</hi> or great <hi>Mille; Maſſa-Minkale,</hi> or little <hi>Mille;</hi> and red <hi>Mille,</hi> which they uſe in ſtead of Tares.</p>
                  <p>There grow alſo Potato's, call'd <hi>Limbale Ampaita, Bakovens, Injames,</hi> with them <hi>Imbale, Emtogifto,</hi> or Ginger, and other ſtrange Fruits, as <hi>Goebes, Mando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyns,</hi> or <hi>Dongo</hi> and <hi>Fonſi;</hi> and ſome Herbs, the chief of which they account <hi>Inſanſy,</hi> bitter of taſte; <hi>Imboa,</hi> and <hi>Inſua;</hi> Purceline and wild Fetherfew.</p>
                  <p>They have alſo <hi>Malanga,</hi> or Pumpkins; <hi>Mampet,</hi> or Sugar-Canes; <hi>Mihenga,</hi> a juicy Fruit; but they Plant no more of it than they can eat from hand to hand; and <hi>Maye-Monola,</hi> or Tobacco.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grain of Paradice,</hi> by them ſtil'd <hi>Indonga-Anpota,</hi> grows here, but in no quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, becauſe neither Sown nor Planted.</p>
                  <p>Alſo great abundance of <hi>Banano's</hi> and <hi>Mandioque,</hi> or <hi>Farinha;</hi> of which they make Bread.</p>
                  <p>Of the Leaves of <hi>Majaera</hi> they make a pretty reliſhing and ſavory Food, dreſſing it with ſmoaked Fiſh, Palm-Oyl, Salt, and <hi>Achy,</hi> or <hi>Braſile</hi> Pepper: but their common Food is <hi>Fondy,</hi> or <hi>Sonſy,</hi> made of the Flour of <hi>Mille.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are alſo many <hi>Calabaſſes,</hi> which grown ripe, they dry and make Diſhes of for ſeveral uſes.</p>
                  <p>A ſort of little Apples grows on low Trees, which prove a very refreſhing Fruit, and good to put into Drink as Spice, or as the <hi>Kola.</hi> There is a larger ſort thereof call'd <hi>Cucomba,</hi> crude, ſowre, and corroding, but boyl'd, taſtes very well.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kola</hi> grows on great Trees in Husks, ten and twelve together, and yields Fruit once a year. This, as experience teacheth, eaten in the Evening hinders ſleep.</p>
                  <p>The Root <hi>Melando,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Melando.</note> whoſe Leaf climbeth up on a Tree or Pole (like our Hops) eaten gives an <hi>Aromatick</hi> taſte.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſsia Fiſtula,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Caſsia Fiſtula.</note> or Pipe Caſſia, they uſe in their Witchcrafts and Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Of Oranges,
<note place="margin">Oranges, Lemons, and Coco-Nuts.</note> Lemons, and Coco-Nuts, they have but few; for ſetting no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue on them, they will not beſtow the pains to tranſplant and propagate them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Achy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Achy.</note> or <hi>Braſilian</hi> Pepper, groweth wild, and much uſed; ſo alſo Cotton.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>All theſe Fruits continue the whole year through, except between <hi>Majumba,</hi> and <hi>Cabo de Gonzalvez;</hi> whoſe Inhabitants uſe <hi>Bananos</hi> in ſtead of Bread; and Fiſh for other Proviſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Matombe</hi> Trees grow numerouſly,
<note place="margin">Matombe.</note> but yet exceeded by the vaſt multitude of Palm Trees.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Matombes</hi> afford, firſt good Wine, which they drink in ſtead of that of Palm, but not ſo ſtrong: The Branches make Rafters and Laths for the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Couches to Sleep on: The Leaves are uſed for Tiles, and Fence off the greateſt Rains.</p>
                  <p>All the Garments worn in <hi>Lovango,</hi> are made of theſe Leaves, which they uſe alſo in ſtead of Money, having no ſort of Mettal Coyn'd: but becauſe the <hi>Matombe</hi> Leaves are not ſo ſtrong as thoſe of the Palm; the Clothes made thereof are in leſs eſteem, ſeldom making of it any other than courſe <hi>Jago</hi>-Clothes.</p>
                  <p>Their manur'd ground is ſo furtile, that it affords three Crops,
<note place="margin">The Seed ground.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> ſmall <hi>Mille,</hi> little Beans, and Wigge that is ſown with <hi>Mille,</hi> as Rape with us.</p>
                  <p>Some have their Lands, one, two, or three miles; others, a day or two's Journey from their Dwellings, whether they go at Seed-time, and remain with their Families, till they have Sow'd their Ground, then return to their Habitations again.</p>
                  <p>They Plough not the Land, but break it up with an Inſtrument like a Hoe,
<note place="margin">How their Land is Plow'd.</note> or rather a Maſons Trowel, but broader and hollower.</p>
                  <p>Hoggs, <hi>Cabrietes,</hi> or Sheep, Goats, Cows, and all ſorts of Fowls,
<note place="margin">The living Creatures.</note> breed more plentifully here, than in any other places, on the Coaſt of <hi>Congo,</hi> or <hi>Angola.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:56692:314"/>
                  <p>The Inhabitants are ſtrong Limb'd,
<note place="margin">The kind of Inhabitants.</note> large of Stature, and decent in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior; commonly jealous of their Wives, yet themſelves Wanton and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt; covetous and greedy to attain Riches, yet generous and free hearted one to another; very much addicted to Drinking Wine of Palm, yet ſlighting our <hi>European</hi> Wine; no Zealots in matters of Religion, yet extreamly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, ſo that it is pity they want the knowledge of Real and Divine Truths.</p>
                  <p>The Men wear long Garments,
<note place="margin">Their Cloathing.</note> reaching from then middle down to their Feet, and below border'd with Fringe, but leave the upper part of their Body naked: The Stuffs whereof they are made, may be divided into four ſorts, one of which none may wear but the King, and thoſe he permits out of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Favor, or as marks of Dignity. They are call'd ſometimes <hi>Libongo;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles <hi>Bondo,</hi> which no Weavers are permitted to Sell, upon pain of Death. There are two other ſorts uſually ſold, the beſt call'd <hi>Kimbes,</hi> being a Habit for the greateſt Nobleman; made very fine, and with curious Workmanſhip Flowr'd,
<note place="margin">Fit for Handkerchiefs.</note> and beautifi'd with exquiſite Imagery, each Cloth holding about two Spans and a half in Square, which a Weaver with his greateſt diligence may well ſpend fifteen or ſixteen days in Working to finiſh it. The ſecond ſort call'd <hi>Sokka,</hi> are leſs by one half than the <hi>Kimbes;</hi> yet many that have little handl'd their Work, would eaſily miſtake the one for the other; for both are high, and Cutwork, with Images, or Figures upon them, but the turn'd ſide gives the diſtinction, by the Courſeneſs or Fineneſs. Six of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Pieces make a Garment, which they know how to Colour, Red, Black, or Green.</p>
                  <p>The two other ſorts of Cloathes are a wearing for Common People, being plain, without Images or Figures, yet have their diſtinctions; one being cloſer and firmer wrought than the other. Theſe are many times Slaſh'd or Pink'd, from the middle to the knees, as old faſhion'd <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Breeches were wont, with ſmall and great cuts.</p>
                  <p>Every man, by promiſe or injunction, is bound to wear a Furr-skin over his Cloathes, right before his Privacies; <hi>viz.</hi> of a tame Cat, Otter, Cattamoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, great Wood or wild Cat, or of an <hi>Agali,</hi> or Civet Cat; with whoſe Civet they ſometimes alſo anoint themſelves. Beſides theſe, they have very fair ſpeckl'd Skins, call'd <hi>Enkiny,</hi> of high Price among them, which none may wear, but the King and his peculiar Favorites.</p>
                  <p>Some Perſons of high Degree when they Travel, wear ſix or eight Skins for Garments; others, as the King and his greateſt Nobility, cauſe five or ſix Skins to be ſew'd together, interlac'd with many white and black ſpeckl'd Tails of the foremention'd <hi>Enkiny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Croſs-wiſe in the midſt of the Skin, they ſet commonly round, Tufts made of the aforeſaid Furr, and white and black Parrets Feathers; and at the edges Elephants Hair, ſpread round in winding-Trails. Every one alſo wears a String about his middle, made of the peeling of <hi>Matombe</hi> Leaves, of which there are two ſorts; one call'd <hi>Poes-anana,</hi> and the other <hi>Poes-anpoma;</hi> with which they tye their Cloathes faſt.</p>
                  <p>Beſides they have two Girdles one above another, that is, one of fine Red or Black Cloath, ſlightly Embroyder'd in three or four places; the other of Yarn, wrought in Flowers, and faſtned together before with double Strings, call'd <hi>Pondes.</hi> Theſe Girdles are commonly three or four Inches broad; wherefore the Cloathes ſent thither out of <hi>Europe</hi> with broad Liſts, ſerve to be Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd and Quill'd to make ſuch Girdles.</p>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:56692:314"/>
                  <p>Some wear Girdles of Bulruſhes, and young Palm Branches; others of peel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a Tree call'd <hi>Catta;</hi> and in other places <hi>Emſande,</hi> which they Weave and Pleit together; of the ſame peelings Match for Guns is made, which ſtand the <hi>Portugals</hi> in good ſtead.</p>
                  <p>Between the upper and lower Girdle they ſet ſeveral ſorts of Ornaments, and about their Necks white and black Beads; the latter they call <hi>Inſimba Frot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and the white <hi>Inſimba Gemba;</hi> but the laſt bears the greateſt value.</p>
                  <p>Others wear Triangular Breaſt-Chains, brought thither out of <hi>Europe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Ornament.</note> and by them nam'd <hi>Panpanpane;</hi> ſome Ivory cut in pieces, and ſome ſort of flat <hi>Scalops,</hi> which they poliſh very ſmooth and round, and wear them ſtrung as Neck-Laces.</p>
                  <p>On their naked legs they put Braſs, Copper, or Iron Rings, about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſmalleſt end of a Tobacco Pipe; or elſe trim them with black and white Beads.</p>
                  <p>On their Arms they wear many Rings of ſeveral faſhions, and light; which they temper in the Forging with Oyl of Palm.</p>
                  <p>Over their Shoulders they hang a Sack, about three quarters of a yard long, ſew'd together, onely a little opening left to put in the hand.</p>
                  <p>Upon their Head they have an artificial Cap, made to ſit cloſe.</p>
                  <p>And in their Hands, either a great Knife, Bowe and Arrows, or a Sword; for they never go without Arms.</p>
                  <p>The Womens Clothes, which come a little below their knees, are made of the ſame with the Mens; over which they ſometimes put ſome fine <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Stuff or Linen, but without any Girdles: The uppermoſt part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Head remains always naked and bare, but on their Arms, Legs, and Necks, many Rings, Beads and other Toys.</p>
                  <p>Their uſual Diet is freſh and ſmoak'd Fiſh, eſpecially <hi>Sardyn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Food.</note> which they take with a Hook, and Boyl with Herbs and <hi>Achy,</hi> or <hi>Braſilian Pepper.</hi> People of Quality eat with their Fiſh <hi>Maſſanga,</hi> or ſmall <hi>Mille,</hi> firſt ſtamp'd with a Peſtle, then Boyled with Water, and ſo Kneaded together.</p>
                  <p>They Swear by the King, ſpeaking theſe words, <hi>Fyga Manilovanga;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Oath, or Swearing.</note> but the higheſt Oath is, the Drinking of <hi>Bondes Root;</hi> and never uſed, but when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is preſently to be undertaken or perform'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bondes</hi> is onely a Root of a Tree, of a ruſſet Colour, very Bitter,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bondes</hi> Root, or Adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Root.</note> and aſtringent; and gets (as they ſay) by enchantment of the <hi>Ganga,</hi> or Conjurer, perfect power and vertue. This Root they ſcrape with a Knife, and put into a Pot of Water, of which the accuſed Party takes about a Pint and half, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by a perſon appointed by the King for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>In like manner, if any weighty or criminal matter, either of Sorcery or Theft be laid to any ones charge, and it cannot be aſcertain'd by the Oracle of <hi>Ganga</hi> or their Conjurer; they forthwith condemn the ſuſpected perſon to drink of the <hi>Bonde</hi>-drink, which is perform'd in this manner;</p>
                  <p>The Complainant muſt go to the King,
<note place="margin">How the <hi>Bonde</hi>-drink is drank.</note> and beſeech him to appoint an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator of the <hi>Bondes;</hi> for which he pays the King his due. Theſe <hi>Bonde</hi>-givers are about eight or ten perſons, appointed by the King and his Nobility; who meeting under the open Heaven, in a broad way, ſit down upon the ground, and about three a Clock in the afternoon, begin their work, for by that, the Complainers muſt be there; who coming with their whole Retinue and Generation, the <hi>Bonde</hi>-givers, admoniſh to bring to light the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Matter, without any ſiding or partiality; which he adjures them to with an Oath by their <hi>Fetiſies,</hi> which they have ſtanding round about them. Then alſo appears the Accus'd, with his Family; for ſeldom one perſon alone, but commonly, the whole Neighbourhood is accus'd; theſe meet, and ſtanding in a row, come by courſe one by one to the <hi>Bonde</hi>-givers, (who have a little Drum, upon which they continually Beat,) and receiving about a Pint and a half of Liquor, they retire to their places again.</p>
                  <p>After this, one of the <hi>Bonde</hi>-givers riſeth up, with certain ſticks of a <hi>Bacoven</hi> tree in his hands, which he flings after the Accus'd, requiring him to fall down; and if he have no guilt, to ſtand up and make Water, in token of his Innocency. Then the <hi>Bonde</hi>-giver cuts the Root before them all, that every one may walk up and down over it. In the doing whereof, if one or other of them chance to fall, then the ſtanders by ſet up a loud Cry, and the party fall'n, lieth like a poſſeſs'd man, ſpeechleſs, but with horrible Convulſions in all his Limbs, not enduring his body to be touch'd; and this they hold for a
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:56692:315"/>certain ſign, that ſuch a Perſon is guilty of what he was charged withall. But thoſe which Urine, receive acclamations of joy and praiſe, and both Strangers and his Friends conduct him to his Dwelling, declaring his innocency to every one they meet. On the other hand, if it be a matter criminal, that the queſtion'd Perſon ſtands thus convict, or that he hath many ill-willers, they preſently carry him about a quarter of an hours Journey from the place of Trial to a broad Way, and there cut him in pieces: but if it be but ſome Peccadillio, or they have a mind to ſpare the accuſed, then with Man's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, mingled with Water and ſome green Herbs pour'd into his Mouth (which is the onely Antidote) they ſeek to expell the Poyſon.</p>
                  <p>Some when they are accuſed have permiſſion for their Slaves to drink in their ſtead; but if he falls aſleep, the Maſter himſelf muſt take it, and in his ſleep the Antidote is given. If the Maſter fall, and it be a great Crime, he muſt die; but a ſmall matter, he buys off the offence with ſome Slaves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bonde</hi>-givers oftentimes uſe great jugling and impoſture; for though a Perſon have no guilt, yet he will by his Sorcery make him fall, if either the People hate him, or the Accuſers be great.</p>
                  <p>Many alſo, whoſe guilt their evil living ſufficiently demonſtrates, ſo corrupt by Bribes and Gifts, that they ſeem innocent; but by this means it goes very hard with the Poor, who generally ſuffer, while it may be the guilty ſit by laughing at their inferiors; ſo true is that of the old Poet,
<q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>
                              <hi>Nil habet infoelix Paupertas durius in ſe</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>
                              <hi>Quam quod ridiculos homines facit</hi>—</l>

                           <l>Than ſcorn, and be contemptible to all.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Accuſers bring the Convict naked (for the Maſter of the <hi>Bondes</hi> takes his Cap and his Cloathes as his Vails) before the King's Court, where he receives ſentence of death, to be hew'd in pieces, as we related before.</p>
                  <p>They uſe no peculiar Ceremonies in Marriage,
<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> nor ſcarce trouble themſelves for conſent of Friends: ſome chuſe Children of ſix, ſeven, or eight years of Age, who when they arrive to ten, they take home and bring up in private: If afterwards any behave themſelves impudently, the Husband may without any Man's gainſaying puniſh her.</p>
                  <p>But ſome Parents will not let their Daughters Marry, till arrived to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Womanhood; and then whoever deſires to Match with her, he goes to her Friends, and buys her of them at a certain Price.</p>
                  <p>If it happen (as it doth very often) that a Maid be enticed to leudeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Marriage, they muſt both appear in the preſence of ſome hundreds of Men before the King at his Court, and declaring their fault, the King gives pardon.</p>
                  <p>And this they judge ſo neceſſary, that many aſſuredly believe, if they had not obtain'd abſolution from the King in manner beforemention'd, that the whole Countrey would periſh with drowth, and it would not Rain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as yet the like buſineſs is perform'd by others that have no ſuch belief, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquainting the King.</p>
                  <p>The Child follows the Mother, and is a Slave if ſhe be ſo, though the Father be a Free-man; but if the Mother be free, and the Father a Slave, yet the Child is free.</p>
                  <p>Every Noble-man may have as many Wives as he hath ability to Cloathe, and can procure Fiſh and Wine for their moderate Maintenance; ſo that
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:56692:316"/>ſome have ten or twelve; but every ordinary perſon hath commonly two or three.</p>
                  <p>The Women do all the ſervile works, for they break the Ground, Sowe and Reap, pluck up the <hi>Mille,</hi> beat it into Meal, boyl it, and give it to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to eat, who take care for nothing but Drink. When the Husband eats, the Wife ſits afar off, and takes the leavings; and withall ſo ſlaviſhly ſubject to their Husbands, that they dare not ſpeak to them but upon their bare Knees, and in meeting them, as a demonſtration of their ſubmiſſion, muſt creep upon their Hands.</p>
                  <p>They colour their whole Bodies with <hi>Takoel</hi>-Wood ground upon Stones, and ſo made a fit Painting.</p>
                  <p>If it happen, that one enjoys another Man's Wife, they fall into great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about it, untill ſatisfaction be given to the injur'd Party, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made, to which of them ſhe ſhall belong: Nor doth this Quarrel bound it ſelf within the Families of theſe, but all the Neighbors of the Place, where the injur'd Perſon dwells, think themſelves oblig'd to help him; as on the other hand, the Offender's Neighbors help him, yet ſtill with this caution, that they ſpare no endeavor to make peace: However this raiſes jealouſies among them, which ſometimes riſe to that heighth, as to end in blood.</p>
                  <p>When any die,

In the mean time his neareſt Relations bring ſeveral of their Goods to caſt by the Corps in the Grave, as alſo all his own, and then ſnatching it up, run away therewith, as if they had ſtoll'n it. Part of the Goods they bury with him, and part they ſet upon the Grave upon Poles; but firſt they cut them to prevent ſtealing. In the Evening the Friends aſſemble again, and bemone the Dead: And this they continue ſix Weeks every Morning and Evening.</p>
                  <p>When any of Quality dies,

                  <p>The Dead lieth in the midſt, or ſits ſometimes upon a Mat, or Block, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and propp'd up with Wood to keep him from falling. They pare his Nails, ſhave off his Hair, anoint his Body with <hi>Takoel</hi>-Wood; and in the mean while the Women run about and relate his Life and Speeches by rule and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſetting forth alſo the greatneſs of his Linage and Family, with what State and Grandeur he maintain'd himſelf and Retinue, whom he accounted his Friends, and whom his Enemies. This Relation of his Enemies immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately raiſing jealouſies in the heads of his ſurviving Friends, they begin to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the cauſe of his Death; whereof not able to obtain any certainty, they reſolve to go to the <hi>Moquiſies</hi> for advice. While this continues in debate, every one brings and gives to the next Friends, or thoſe whom his Death moſt concerns, ſome Cloathes or Garments, wherewith to defray the Expences, which they ſhall be at in ſearching out the cauſe of the Deceaſed's Death. This having continued two, three, or more days and nights, with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:56692:316"/>of Laments; at laſt they run away with the Corps, and bury it either in the Fields, or by <hi>Chienga,</hi> where divers Wizards call'd <hi>Kokokoo,</hi> dwell, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of his Goods into the Grave, and part over it, as we have it, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly one of his <hi>Moquiſies,</hi> that is, a Pot, a Wooden Shovel, an Arrow, <hi>Kalbas,</hi> a Cup to drink in, Tobacco, a Pipe, a Staff, Lances, or ſuch like. After this the neareſt Friends continue their Morning and Evening Laments, ſometimes for two or three Moneths, or longer.</p>
                  <p>Now if the neareſt to the Deceaſed will ſhew his duty, in ſearching after the cauſe of his Death, he falls upon the inquiry; for which they uſe ſeveral ways, but the following is the moſt common.</p>
                  <p>They go to the <hi>Conga,</hi> or Wizard, ſitting upon the Ground behind a Houſe,
<note place="margin">How the cauſe of any Man's death is ſearched after.</note> and lay a great Knife down before him, which he oftentimes touches, and then rubs his hands one upon another; whereupon they ſpeak to him in theſe words: <hi>Such a one is deceaſed, or dead, we have buried him, is he brought to his end by Witchcraft? or have his</hi> Moquiſies <hi>kill'd him?</hi> If upon this enquiring the Hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſtrike hard one upon another without any more rubbing, they take it for granted his <hi>Moquiſies</hi> kill'd him. Again, if the hands in rubbing happen to ſtrike one another, and he brings them right again with clapping, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin once more, and ask again, <hi>Such a one is dead, and brought to his end by</hi> Moquiſies, <hi>or Witchcraft, where dwells he? who hath done it? here or yonder, or is he of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</hi> &amp;c. till they know more; or if they ſuppoſe more had a hand in it than one, they ask, <hi>Whether Man or Woman did it, by what</hi> Moquiſies <hi>he was bewitched, and what cauſe they had for it,</hi> and the like. Sometimes they run two or three Moneths from one Town to another, and from one <hi>Ganga</hi> to another, and leave no <hi>Moquiſies</hi> almoſt unasked, till at length they ſuppoſe how it was done, or in what Town he dwells, or under whom he lives: If they dare not name or diſcover the Perſon, they take the whole Town, that they may find out the Guilty therein; and applying themſelves for that end to one of the King's No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, enquire whether there be a <hi>Bony,</hi> that is, a Hamlet where they ſuppoſe the ſuſpected Party to be, that he may drink <hi>Bondes,</hi> who gives them leave: Then he goes to the chiefeſt of the <hi>Bondes,</hi> call'd <hi>Konda,</hi> and ſeeks for ſome to make ready the <hi>Bonde</hi>-Drink, and to adminiſter it.</p>
                  <p>In the Morning when they intend to begin, they come to the <hi>Boany,</hi> or Hamlet, together, ſetting themſelves down in the midſt of the Village, in an open place upon the Market, if there be one: and then the <hi>Bondes</hi> takes out of every Hamlet a Man, who drinks for the whole. Now if one of theſe fall, that Hamlet, for which he drank, muſt all hand the Cup one to another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe the guilty Perſon hides himſelf therein.</p>
                  <p>If all the Men eſcape, then comes the lot to the Women, who drink not themſelves, but others in their Names; and if there ſhall fall one, or more, the Women for whom they drank are taken for guilty, and as Sorcereſſes are put to death. But of this we have ſaid more than enough.</p>
                  <p>The Children inherit not after the Father's Deceaſe, but the eldeſt Brother,

                  <p>There are many Handicrafts among them, as Weavers, Smiths, Cap-makers,
<note place="margin">Employments.</note> Potters, Bead-makers, Carpenters, Vintners, or Tapſters, Fiſher-men, <hi>Canoo</hi>-makers, Merchants, and other Traders. They make a kind of Hemp, taken out from the peel'd Leaves of the <hi>Matombe</hi>-Trees, about three quarters of a Yard ſquare. This Hemp is of two ſorts, the one call'd <hi>Poeſana,</hi> fit onely for
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:56692:317"/>courſe Cloathes; and the other <hi>Poeſampama,</hi> whereof they Weave finer.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> buy thoſe Clothes in great abundance, and carry them to <hi>Lovango Saint Paulo,</hi> where they are deliver'd in ſtead of Money; for in that place they are the ſtandard to value all Commodities by. Every Cloth, call'd by the <hi>Portugueſe Panos Sambes;</hi> and in Countrey phraſe, <hi>Mollole-Vierry,</hi> conſiſts of four pieces ſtitch'd together, call'd <hi>Libonges;</hi> ſeventeen ſuch are valu'd at for one piece of Slezy Ticking; and every pound of Ivory, bears the price of five <hi>Libonges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner the Inhabitants of <hi>Lovango,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Money.</note> in ſtead of Money, uſe ſleight wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Clothes, made of the Leaves of <hi>Matombe</hi>-Trees, every Cloth conſiſting of four pieces, each of about a Span and half ſquare; of which one is worth a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: but of late theſe Clothes are fallen low, and conſequently little uſed.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the riches of the Inhabitants conſiſts in Slaves,
<note place="margin">Riches.</note> for what other wealth they have, is laviſh't out profuſely in idle expences.</p>
                  <p>The Merchandizes brought out of this Countrey by the <hi>Whites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Trade.</note> are Elephants Teeth, Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, and other things; but are gotten with great labour, by the Inhabitants, becauſe of the far lying off of the Mines.</p>
                  <p>From a certain place call'd <hi>Sondy,</hi> not far from <hi>Abyſine,</hi> or the Empire of <hi>Preſter John,</hi> moſt of the Copper is brought thither.</p>
                  <p>Towards <hi>September</hi> there flock to <hi>Sondy,</hi> many Smiths from ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys to melt Copper; who continue there till <hi>May,</hi> and then depart, becauſe of the approaching dry time. But by the unskilfulneſs of the Inhabitants, this Copper is much debas'd, who melt all Mettals one among another; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which, ſome have been ſent where the Mines are, to teach them to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and ſeparate the Mettals; but they would never permit them to do any thing, or be drawn to alter their own vicious method.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Whites</hi> bring alſo out of this Countrey Elephants-Tails, which the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> buy and carry to <hi>Lovango Saint Paulo,</hi> where they prove very good and ready Merchandize; that is, an hundred Hairs put together, they value at a thouſand <hi>Rees.</hi> This Hair the <hi>Blacks</hi> braid very finely, and wear about their Necks; but the greateſt and longeſt Hairs braided, they wear about the Waſte; of which, fifty Hairs are ſold for a thouſand <hi>Rees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lovango,</hi> uſeth to vent yearly great abundance of Ivory; but every year the quantity decreaſes, becauſe the <hi>Blacks</hi> fetch it ſo far out of the Countrey, and carry it upon their Heads. The chiefeſt place where the Staple for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity remains, is call'd <hi>Backkamele,</hi> about three hundred miles up into the Countrey, ſo that the <hi>Blacks</hi> have near three moneths labour, before they can finiſh their journey forwards and backwards.</p>
                  <p>The Merchandize brought by thoſe of <hi>Lovango,</hi> are Salt, Oyl of Palm, broad Knives, made by themſelves, courſe Sleſie Tickings, black Looking-Glaſſes, Cuſhion Leaves, and ſome other Trifles, beſides Slaves and Elephants-Teeth: In the former of which, they make uſe of theſe Slaves to carry their goods from place to place, to ſave other extraordinary charge of carriage.</p>
                  <p>The Roads from <hi>Lovango</hi> to <hi>Pombo, Sondy, Monſel, Great Mokoko,</hi> and other places, are much infeſted by the <hi>Jages;</hi> ſo that it is dangerous for Merchants to travel that way; though they uſually go in whole Troops under a chief Commander that is very faithful to them.</p>
                  <p>But for the obtaining of free Trade in <hi>Lovango,</hi> the <hi>Whites</hi> muſt continually give preſents to the King, and his Mother the Queen, and two Noblemen, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Overſeers of the Factory, call'd <hi>Manikes,</hi> and <hi>Manikinga,</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
                  <pb n="503" facs="tcp:56692:317"/>
                  <p>In Trading, the <hi>Blacks</hi> of <hi>Lovango</hi> uſe their own Language, yet ſome Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on the Shore ſpeak broken <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> and there commonly ſerve as Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, between the Buyers and Sellers; as in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Lovango</hi> hath ſeveral eminent Councellors,
<note place="margin">Government.</note> with whom he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes in matters of State, Entituled, <hi>Mani-Bomme, Mani-Mambo, Mani-Beloor,</hi> and <hi>Mani-Belullo, Mani-Kinga, Mani-Matta,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, or <hi>Mani-Bomme,</hi> which is as much as Lord Admiral, hath under his Juriſdiction <hi>Lovangiri,</hi> and is indeed the moſt eminent of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, <hi>Mani-Mamba,</hi> ſuperviſes <hi>Lovangomongo;</hi> but not alone, for he hath generally two or three joyn'd with him in Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>The third, <hi>Mani-Beloor,</hi> is chief Superintendent over <hi>Chilongo;</hi> and beſides that Charge, hath the Office of Searcher over the <hi>Dockies</hi> or Sorcerers, and takes care of ſuch as fall under the <hi>Bondes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great Province of <hi>Chilongatiamokango,</hi> as free Lord he rules without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging any ſubjection to the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mani-Kinga,</hi> is Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Piri;</hi> and <hi>Mani-Matta,</hi> Captain of the Guard; for <hi>Matta</hi> ſignifies a Bowe, and <hi>Mani</hi> a Prince.</p>
                  <p>The King, for the better managing of his weighty affairs, hath ſeveral other inferior Officers; as <hi>Manidonga,</hi> Governor of <hi>Pattovey</hi> to Guard the King's Wives; two <hi>Manaenders,</hi> that is, Butlers to the King in the day, and two other for the night: <hi>Moeton Ambamma,</hi> ſervant of the great Captain <hi>Bamma;</hi> with a multitude of others.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all theſe, the great Butler bears no ſmall ſway; his title, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonde-Lovango,</hi> that is, <hi>Upper Butler of Lovango,</hi> for he takes care of all Vyands, and hath four other under him; whereof (as we ſaid) two in the day time, when the King is in the Wine-Houſe; and two in the evening perform their ſervice: and laſtly, every diviſion of the Countrey hath a particular Nobleman appointed by the King; as we in Hundreds have Juſtices of the Peace.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Lovango</hi> hath the repute of a potent Lord,
<note place="margin">The Power of the King.</note> being able to bring numerous Armies into the Field, and that not ſo much reſpected, as dreaded by the Kings of <hi>Calongo,</hi> and <hi>Goy;</hi> yet he liveth in friendſhip with them, and holds good correſpondency with thoſe of <hi>Angola;</hi> his Juriſdiction extends into the Countrey Eaſtward, almoſt as far as on the Sea Coaſt, being known by the general name of <hi>Mouriſſe,</hi> and <hi>Manilovango.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The adminiſtration of Juſtice, and puniſhing of Vice,
<note place="margin">Juſtice.</note> ſeems to be according to the Law of Retaliation; for Theft is not puniſh'd by Death, except it be againſt the King; but when they take a Thief either in the very act, or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the things ſtoln muſt be made good by him or his Friends, and the Thief bound, expos'd for a ſcorn and deriſion of every one, in the midſt of the Street.</p>
                  <p>If any be found Guilty, whoſe miſerable poverty affords no means of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, then may the offended ſeek remedy, every man of the Tribe or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration whereof he was, and make them work for him, till he receive the full recompence of his loſſes.</p>
                  <p>The King hath (by the report of the <hi>Blacks</hi>) near ſeven thouſand Wives;
<note place="margin">The King hath many Wives.</note> for after the deceaſe of one King, his Succeſſor keeps all his Wives, and brings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many beſides to them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Wives are kept in no great reſpect; for they muſt work no leſs than other women: Some few of them he ſelects for his Amours, and with them
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:56692:318"/>ſpends much time; the other he ſhuts up as Nunns in Cloyſters.</p>
                  <p>When one of theſe proves with Child, one muſt drink <hi>Bonde</hi> for her, to know whether this Woman hath had to do with any other beſides the King. Now if the Man who hath ſo drank be well, they judge the Woman upright; but if the Man falls, ſhe is condemn'd and burnt, and the Adulterer buried alive.</p>
                  <p>The King as ſupream Governor,
<note place="margin">A Mother is appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the King.</note> appropriates to himſelf one to be as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a grave Matron, and of good and try'd experience, which they call <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konda;</hi> whom he reverences with more honour than his own natural Mother. This <hi>Makonda</hi> hath a great prerogative and priviledge, to do good offices both to the Nobility and common People, that fall into the diſ-favour of the King; who is neceſſitated in all weighty affairs to uſe her Counſel: for ſhe hath ſuch authority,
<note place="margin">Her Authority.</note> that if the King provokes her any way, and doth not grant her Suit ſpeedily, ſhe may take away his life.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, ſhe takes the advantage (without any daring to controll her) to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate her unruly appetite, as often, and with whom ſhe pleaſes; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Children ſhe hath by ſuch means, bears all the ſame repute that proceeds of the Royal Race: but if her Gallants meddle with other Women, they are by authority of the Law, puniſhed with Death; ſo that theſe accounted felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties carry with them their infortune: and if they imagine themſelves detected, they have no way to preſerve their Lives but by flight.</p>
                  <p>When the King dies,
<note place="margin">The Inheritance of the Crown.</note> his Children ſucceed not, but the Crown devolves to his eldeſt Brother; and for want of Brothers, to his Siſters Children.</p>
                  <p>Such as may pretend any right to the Crown, have their Dwellings in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cities and Towns; and as they come nearer to the Government, the nigher they draw towards <hi>Lovango:</hi> now ſo ſoon as the King dies, the Lord which dwelleth in the next Town of all, cometh to the Dominion, and he that dwelleth neareſt to him, ſupplieth his place again, and ſo on to the laſt, with this Proviſo, that they muſt be of Noble Blood by the Mothers ſide.</p>

                  <p>After the Deceaſe of the old King, <hi>Mani-Kay</hi> ſucceeded, and <hi>Mani-Bocke</hi> came again in his place, and every one follows his Lot.</p>
                  <p>The King's youngeſt Brother hath his Manſion in <hi>Chilaſia,</hi> and from thence comes to <hi>Bocke</hi> upon the firſt Vacancy; and if he hath a Child by his Wife, and have offer'd Sacrifice to their <hi>Cares,</hi> or baniſh'd Gods, removes to <hi>Kay,</hi> the next place to the Royal Seat.</p>
                  <p>After the deceaſe of the <hi>Mani-Kay,</hi> immediately enters upon the Government, yet comes not preſently into the Court, but continues near ſix Moneths in his own City, till all Ceremonies of the Burial be perform'd.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Mani</hi> ſignifies <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> and is the greateſt Title of Honour or Expreſſion which they give one among another; the King himſelf hath the

                  <p>The King and his Brothers are commonly jealous one of another; for if any one of them happen to be ſick, they preſently ſuſpect State-policy.</p>
                  <p>The King commonly wears Cloth or Stuff, which the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King's Cloathing.</note> or other <hi>Whites,</hi> bring to them. The King and great Noble-men have on their left Arm the Skin of a wild Cat ſew'd together, with one end ſtuffed round and ſtiff.</p>
                  <p>The King hath peculiar Orders and Cuſtoms in Eating and Drinking;
<note place="margin">Cuſtoms of the King's in Eating and Drinking.</note> for which he keeps two ſeveral Houſes, one to eat in, and the other to drink in; and although he hath many Houſes, yet by vertue of this Cuſtom he may uſe no other. He makes two Meals a day, the firſt in the Morning, about ten a Clock; where his Meat is brought in cover'd Baskets, near which a Man goes with a great Bell, to give notice to every one of the coming of the Kings Diſhes: whereupon the King, ſo ſoon as he is acquainted with it, leaves the Company he is withall, and goes thither.

                  <p>A <hi>Portugueſe</hi> of <hi>Lovango,</hi> named <hi>St. Paulo,</hi> lying in <hi>Angola</hi> to Trade, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the King with a brave Dog, which for his faithfulneſs he loved very much: This Dog, not ſo ſtrictly look'd to by his Keeper, while the King was eating, ran ſmelling and ſeeking after his Maſter, whom he miſſed, and came at length, without any body's minding him, to the Door, which with his Noſe he thruſt open, and went to the King whom he ſaw eating: but the King cauſed his Servants inſtantly with a Rope to put the Dog to death; for be it Man or Child, Mouſe, Cat or Dog, or any other living Creature that hath ſeen the King eat, if it can be gotten, it eſcapes not death.</p>
                  <p>It happened, that a Noble-man's Child, about ſeven or eight years old, who was with his Father in the King's Banquetting-houſe, fell aſleep, and when the King was drinking, awaked; whereupon it was inſtantly ſentenc'd to die, with a reprieve only for ſix or ſeven days at the Fathers requeſt; that time elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Child was ſtruck upon the Noſe with a Smiths Hammer, and the blood dropped upon the King's <hi>Makiſies,</hi> and then with a Cord about his Neck was dragg'd upon the Ground to a broad Way, to which Malefactors are drawn, which cannot bear the trial of the <hi>Bonde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the King hath done eating, he goes accompanied in State with the Nobility, Officers, and common People, to his Banquetting-houſe, the greateſt and moſt ſumptuous Structure in all his Court, ſcituate on a Plain, fenced with Palm-Tree Boughs; wherein the moſt difficult cauſes of difference, are decided and determin'd in his preſence.</p>

                  <p>Before the King's Seat lieth ſpread a great Cloth twenty Fathom long, and twelve broad, made of quilted Leaves ſew'd together, upon which none may go but the King and his Children; but round it they leave room for two or three perſons to paſs by, the Nobility ſitting in long Ranks, every one with a Buffles Tail in his Hand, which for the moſt part they move in the preſence of the King: Some ſit upon the bare Ground; others upon Cloathes made of the ſame Stuff with the King's: Behind them ſtand the People; as behind the King all his great Officers, not few in number.</p>
                  <p>In this publick Solemnity of State,
<note place="margin">Playing Inſtruments.</note> there are ſome that very curiouſly Play upon ſeveral Inſtruments of Muſick, of which they uſe three ſorts; firſt, Wind-Inſtruments, made of Ivory in the ſhape of a Hunting-Horn, hollow'd as deep as poſſible, with a hole at the great end, and an Inch and a half, or two Inches broad: Of theſe they have ſeveral ſorts, eight or ten whereof joyn'd in conſort yield a pleaſant ſound.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond ſort are Drums, made of whole hollowed Pieces of Timber, covered over at one end with Leather, or Skins of Wild Beaſts, and at the other end with a ſmall Opening, in which may be put two Fingers. They bear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly on four of theſe together, ſometimes ſtriking with the Palms of the Hands flat-ways, ſometimes with one Stick and one Hand.</p>
                  <p>The third reſembles a Pan or Sieve, ſuch as they uſe for Meal, but the Wood bigger and deeper; round about which are ſome long Holes cut, two and two together, each about a Fingers length: In each Hole they put two Copper Plates, faſtned to the Wood with Copper Pins. This Inſtrument being ſtirred, gives a ſound almoſt like the tinckling of little Bells on the Wheels.</p>
                  <p>At this time many of the Nobility ſalute the King,
<note place="margin">How the Noble-men ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the King with leaping.</note> leaping after a manner which they call <hi>Chilomba,</hi> which they do with great wide Paces and Strides, along by the void ſpaces of the Cloth ſpread upon the riſing Foot-pace; this they perform backward and forward two or three times, moving their Arms this way and that way: Leaping thus, the King and his Nobles receive them with out-ſtretched Arms, and they clap together their Hands two or three times, and then caſt themſelves juſt at the King's Feet into the Sand, and rowl over and over in it, in token of Subjection. Such as are extraordinary Favourites, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving performed this Exerciſe, run directly to the King, and leaning with both Hands upon his Knees, lay their Heads in his Boſom.</p>
                  <p>The Chiefeſt Noble-men have a Seat ſeparate from the King's, to which, for their greater Honor, ſome of the inferior Subjects make the like Leaping; and ſometimes alſo not only one Noble-man ſalutes another ſo, but the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though ſeldom, uſes it.</p>
                  <p>Before the running Paſſage,
<note place="margin">Cryers.</note> about the King's Seat, ſtand three or four Cryers, with Inſtruments in their Hands of the faſhion of Sheeps-bells, but thick and heavy of Iron, upon which they ſtrike with a Stick, to give notice of Silence or Quietneſs, from whence proceeds a dull and hoarſe ſound. Theſe Cryers are alſo Officers of the City, to proclaim the Orders of the King, as alſo to ſignifie when any thing is loſt or found.</p>
                  <p>They have no <hi>decorum</hi> of Modeſty or Civil Deportment; but ſhameleſly, in what Company ſoever, even in the King's preſence, diſcover their Nakedneſs before and behind, in their unſeemly and barbarous Dances.</p>
                  <p>Before the King's Cloth ſit ſome Dwarfs,
<note place="margin">Before the Kings Cloth ſit Dwarfs.</note> with their backs towards him; Pigmies indeed in Stature, but with Heads of a prodigious bigneſs: for the more exact deforming whereof, they wear the Skin of ſome Beaſt tied round about them. The <hi>Blacks</hi> ſay there is a Wilderneſs, where reſide none but Men of ſuch a Stature, who ſhoot thoſe Gigantick Creatures the Elephants. The common Name of theſe Dwarfs is <hi>Bakke Bakke;</hi> but they are alſo call'd <hi>Mimo's.</hi>

                  <p>There ſit alſo certain White Men by the King,
<note place="margin">Their Complexion.</note> with Skins on their Heads, and indeed at diſtance ſeem like our <hi>Europeans,</hi> having not only gray Eyes, but red or yellow Hair; yet coming nearer, the diſcovery grows eaſie: For they have not a lively Colour, but white, like the Skin of a dead Corps, and their Eyes as it were fixed in their Heads, like people that lie a dying: The ſight they have is but weak and dim, turning the Eye like ſuch as look aſquint; but at night they ſee ſtrongly, eſpecially by Moon-ſhine.</p>
                  <p>Some are of opinion that theſe white <hi>Moors</hi> ought to be accounted Fairies,
<note place="margin">Their Generating.</note> and to have ſprung from a great-bellied <hi>Black</hi> with Child, upon ſeeing a <hi>White;</hi> as we read, That a white Woman being Pregnant, upon the ſeeing a Picture of a

                  <p>But <hi>Iſaac Voſsius,</hi> in his Book of the Original of <hi>Nile,</hi> and other Rivers,
<note place="margin">Voſcius lib. de Orig Nili. &amp; lior.

                  <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> call theſe white <hi>Moors, Albinoes,</hi> and attempted to take ſome of them Priſoners in the Wars, and carry them over to <hi>Braſile</hi> to work; for they are very ſtrong, but ſo addicted to idleneſs, that they had rather die than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any toylſom Labour.</p>
                  <p>The like ſort of Men have been found by the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> not only in <hi>Africa,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Borneo,</hi> and in <hi>New Guince,</hi> call'd the Countrey of <hi>Papos.</hi> Thus far <hi>Voſsius.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Solemn Appearance of the King in Publick, begins commonly about three a clock in the Afternoon, and continues till about four or five.</p>
                  <p>All the Wives of the Subjects of this Realm muſt yearly, from the firſt to the fourth of <hi>January,</hi> being the Seed-time, break his Land to be ſown; for the ſpace of about two hours going in length, and one hour in breadth: but the Men are then moſt of them in Arms, and in their beſt Habits, going conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to and fro, to warn the Women to work, and to take care that no violence be done to any.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo the King ſhews himſelf at three a clock after noon, in his higheſt State, to encourage them to work; and in the Evening they all eat at his Charge: So that thoſe days are accounted high Feſtivals.</p>
                  <p>In like manner muſt every Noble-mans Subjects, with their Women, Till their Land: And when they have performed theſe Services, then they may go work for themſelves. And as we have heretofore declared, Every one may Till what Ground he will; but that which one hath cultivated, another may not meddle withal.</p>
                  <p>If any Embaſſador,
<note place="margin">How Embaſſadors or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men ſpeak to the King.</note> or Noble-man of the Countrey deſire to ſpeak to the King in Perſon, they muſt firſt give notice thereof with the ſound of two or three Hand-clappers, which every one preſent in like manner anſwers; then the Suppliant cries out aloud, <hi>Empoo lauſan biau Pongo,</hi> that is, <hi>Hearken for Gods ſake;</hi> whereto the People about him anſwer, and ſpeak, <hi>Tieſambie Zinga,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, <hi>Long live God:</hi> After which the Petitioner begins his Speech with the word <hi>Wag,</hi> uſual among them; and ends with the words <hi>In Mama, Wag,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>I herewith conclude:</hi> Whereupon thoſe that have any thing to ſay againſt it, begin and end in the ſame manner.

                  <p>When any Noble-man hath ſhot a Leopard,
<note place="margin">What is done when a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard is taken.</note> he brings as a token of it, the Tail to the King, upon the top of a <hi>Palmeto</hi> Pole, and pitches it in the Earth, and this without any noiſe or further ceremony.</p>
                  <p>When the Inhabitants of <hi>Lovango</hi> have lodged a Leopard in the Woods, every one is warned by the ſound of Trumpet to be ready to attend the King at the Game. If it be far without the City into the Woods, the King is carried in a four-ſquare Seat, about two Foot deep, made of black Tin, and artificially wrought, by four Men, two before and two behind, holding two Poles, on each ſide one, covered with blue Cloth. Being come to the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards Den, they inſtantly beſet it round, every one being ready prepared, ſome with Bowes and Arrows, and others with Lances and Darts.</p>
                  <p>Before the King, ſtanding a little elevated, they ſpread long Cord-Nets; incircled by the People, that to rowſe the Beaſt, make many ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth noiſes, with Horns, Drums, Shouting, and the like; but at laſt having in vain tried all means of eſcape, tired out and overpower'd with multitude, he falls a Prey to his eager Purſuers, who forthwith bring him into the Plain before the King's Palace, where the Hunters triumph over the Carcaſe with Dancing, Leaping, and Singing, and all kinds of Revelling Paſtimes.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the King appoints divers Noble-men to overſee the Stripping of the Leopard, and bring the Skin to him; but the Fleſh, together with the Bowels, the Gaul only taken out, they bury very deep in the Earth, that it may not be digged up again.
<note place="margin">The Leopards Gaul is Poyſon.</note> The Gaul, which they reckon to be a moſt venomous Poyſon, they cut up in the preſence of many, and fling into the midſt of a River, that none might make uſe thereof to the damage of another.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremonies at the Funeral of a King are theſe:
<note place="margin">The Funeral of the Kings</note> Firſt they make Vaults under ground, wherein they place the dead King in his richeſt Habit, upon a Stool, and by him all manner of Houſhold-ſtuff, as Pots, Kettles, Pans, Clothes, and Garments.</p>
                  <p>Then they make many little Images of Wood and Red Earth, and ſet round about the Corps, Repreſentatives of his Servants and Houſhold-goods.</p>
                  <p>Next, the Bodies of many Slaves are ſet by the Corps, either in the ſame or ſome adjoyning Vault, to ſerve the King, as they believe, in the other World, and to ſhew when they ſhall come to the great Monarch, what manner of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he has been here: for they believe after this another Life, yet in general deride the Reſurrection of the Dead.</p>
                  <p>The Commons ſhew themſelves very humble to the Nobility;
<note place="margin">The Nobility are very much honor'd.</note> for at the meeting of them in the Streets, they fall down upon their Knees, turning their Head another way, ſignifying thereby, that they are not worthy to look upon ſuch: yet when he ſpeaks, then they ſpeak again: So that we may not without Reaſon affirm, That they are little better than Slaves, beyond whom priviledg'd only in this, that they may at pleaſure paſs into any other Countrey, which a Slave without leave cannot do.</p>
                  <p>Noble-men of State have uſually, beſides their Manſion-Houſes, alſo a Wine-Cellar, as hath been ſaid before concerning the King; where they ſpend ſome part of the Day and the Evening in Eating and Drinking; ſome days they have two, three, four, and well near eight <hi>Callabaſſes</hi> of Wine of Palm; of which they impart ſome quantity to their Women, but the reſt they drink with their Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Their Diet is commonly brought thither to them, whereof every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent may take his part.</p>

                  <p>In like manner, whoever hath any Cauſe, may daily come and ſpeak with a Nobleman, there being (as it were) a publick place of receipt, and where pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Differences ariſing between parties, are heard and determin'd.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of the Kingdoms of <hi>Lovango, Kakongo,</hi> and <hi>Goij,</hi>

<note place="margin">In what ſhapes they ſhew themſelves.</note> and ſhew their Figures in ſeveral ſhapes; ſome of Images, like men; others of Poles, with ſmall irons on the top, or elſe a little Carv'd Picture; ſome of which ſhapes or repreſentations, they carry commonly with them when they travel from one place to another. Their greater Idols are ſtuck with Hens or Pheaſants Feathers upon their heads, and with all ſorts of Taſſils and Faſſils about their bodies: Some make them in the faſhion of long Slips, which they wear about their necks and arms; others of Cords, trimm'd with ſmall Feathers, and two or three <hi>Simbos,</hi> or ſmall Horns, with which they adorn their middle, neck and arms: ſome are nothing but Pots fill'd with white earth; others, <hi>Buffels</hi> Horns, ſtuffed with the ſame matter; and at the ſmall end, having Iron Rings.</p>
                  <p>They yet make another ſort more ridiculous than any of the former; the manner thus: They take an ordinary round Pot without feet, which they fill with red and white earth, kneaded together with water, a pretty heighth above the upper edges, which they mark on the outſide quite round with white ſtreaks, and ſtripe it upon the top, with variety of Colours.</p>
                  <p>One of theſe Idols (as they ſay) is jealous of another, inſomuch,
<note place="margin">Several of their Idolgods are Field-Devils.</note> that when they have made one, they preſently go to work upon another; and ſeveral times are neceſſitated to make many, leſt they ſhould offend ſuch as ſeem to be neglected, ſtill making their addreſſes to all, with equal indifferency, as their Protectors and Guardians.</p>
                  <p>They have to inſtruct them in the making theſe Idols, particular Maſters, in their Language call'd <hi>Enganga Mokiſe;</hi> whoſe skill therein they much admire, being put in practiſe in this following manner.</p>

                  <p>On each ſide of his mouth he wears a Parrets feather; and may not clap his hands if any one ſalute him, but as a ſign of greeting, ſtrikes with a ſmall
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:56692:322"/>upon a Block in his hand, made ſloaping, narrow at the top, and in the middle hollow, and on the end a Mans head Carv'd: Of theſe Blocks, this Devil-Hunter hath three ſorts; one great, the other of a middle ſize, and the other ſmall.</p>
                  <p>Theſe prepar'd and made ready, a Fellow brings a Drum to a plain place, whereon no Trees grow, about whom all the Undertakers, Friends and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, make a Ring; whereupon the Drummer ſtanding in the middle, begins to beat, and ſing before the Conjurer, who begins to Dance, followed by every one, while he with an open throat, chants forth the praiſes of the <hi>Mokiſe,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring his aid; the Undertaker alſo (if in health) Dances about the Drum, two or three days, without perceiving any thing of the Devil all that time.</p>
                  <p>At length the Devil-hunter preſents himſelf near the Undertaker, with hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous noiſes and outcries, yet nothing viſible all this while, onely the Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ceaſes a little; and then the <hi>Enganga</hi> ſtrikes upon the aforemention'd Blocks, ſpeaking ſome words, and making ſometimes red and white ſpots in ſeveral parts of the Undertakers body, <hi>viz.</hi> on his Temples and Eye-lids, the pit or hollow of his Stomach, and every Limb, to make him capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the evil Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Being poſſeſs'd, he makes ugly wry faces, and ſtretching his body in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly poſtures, with terrible ſhreeks, takes fire in his hands, and bites with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting himſelf; ſometimes their Devils take him away from them all, and carry him into the wilderneſs to ſome deſolate place, where he ſticks over his whole body green Leaves: During this abſence, which hath no ſet time of continuance, his friends uſe all poſſible endeavors to find him out, but in vain. This they perform with Drums, which they beat all the time, the noiſe whereof, having reach'd the ears of the Poſſeſs'd, he betakes himſelf thither, and ſo is carry'd again to his houſe.</p>
                  <p>The Devil being thus entred, and he Poſſeſs'd, he lieth as it were dead; then the Conjurer asketh what ſhall be inflicted upon him? whereto the Spirit makes anſwer, by the mouth of the Poſſeſs'd, and lays his injunction upon him: upon this they begin again to ſing and to dance, till the Devil comes out of him again; then a Ring is put about his Arms, to put him in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his task.</p>
                  <p>When theſe people Swear, they Swear by this Ring, wiſhing, <hi>That Devil who cauſeth them to wear this Ring, may break their necks if it be not true;</hi> which is the ſooner believed, becauſe they will not ſwear lightly, nor to any thing but the truth; they infallibly keep their words in what they promiſe, though to the hazard of their lives, as hath often appear'd. When the Devil ſpeaks out of the Poſſeſs'd, which oftentimes happens, he endureth great pain, being thrown from one ſide to another, and frothing at the mouth.</p>
                  <p>There are yet other <hi>Mokiſies,</hi> in different manners, which we will relate in ſhort: When any one amongſt them grows ſick, they uſe to cry or call upon their Devil, till he enters into the ſick man; and then they demand why this man is ſick? whether he has broke his commandments? and many more ſuch like queſtions; whereupon the Spirit anſwers out of the mouth of the ſick, and is immediately by promiſe of ſome gifts, hired to effect his cure.</p>

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:56692:322"/>into the number of their Tutelar <hi>Lars;</hi> others give them a common place of reſort, under the earth; while another ſort make for them little Receptacles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Roof of their Houſes, about a ſpan in heighth; before which places, when they eat or drink, they make ſome offering.</p>
                  <p>They further believe, that none can die of a natural death,
<note place="margin">They believe a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die a natural death.</note> but all come to their end by miſchance, that the Inſiliator hath ſome hidden place, where he not onely effects clandeſtinely his deſires, but alſo by the power of Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may ask the deceas'd to come out of the grave, and keep him for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Theſe (as they ſay) are fed daily by the Conjurers, with food boyl'd without any Salt; for if any Salt ſhould come in or near it, the body would follow him openly.</p>
                  <p>They make it an Article of the higheſt Faith, that when a <hi>Mokiſie</hi> offends, or that injunctions or promiſes made to him, are not fully perform'd, that he hath power to kill. Now the reaſon of theſe promiſes happens upon various occaſions; when a child is born, they call a <hi>Fetiſiro</hi> to it,
<note place="margin">How the injunction is made.</note> to enjoyn the child ſomewhat to keep as a law; and this they not onely do to every individual perſon, but to whole Tribes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fetiſero</hi> asks the Parents of the child, what their injunction is, and their Anceſtors; then he propoſes ſomewhat, ſaying, the Oracle, by the <hi>Fetiſie,</hi> has given him to know, that the child ſhall have ſuch an injunction, not to do ſo and ſo; wherein the Mother takes care to inſtruct the child from its youth, that when it ſhall come to years, it may be able to keep it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe injunctions are manifold, as that they may eat no ſuch Fleſh, Herbs,
<note place="margin">Injunctions, how manifold they are.</note> nor Fruits, or eating thereof, they muſt eat it alone, leaving none, and beſides bury the bones in the ground, that they may not be ſcrap'd up again, and eaten by any Dog, Cat, or other living Creature.</p>
                  <p>Some are enjoyn'd not to go over any water; others may not paſs over a River with a <hi>Canoo,</hi> yet admitted to walk, ſwim, or ride thorow: ſome muſt not ſhave the hair of the Head; others may, as alſo their Beards; which again in divers, is an offence beyond pardon.</p>
                  <p>Several are commanded to forbear all Fruits; indulging to others a liberty to devour all, yet again reſtraining many.</p>
                  <p>In relation to Garments the commands are general;
<note place="margin">Injunctions about mens Clothes.</note> for all men muſt wear a Girdle made of the skin of ſome living Creature, which muſt be faſten'd in a peculiar manner above their Belly; Caps upon their heads, or elſe in ſtead thereof, a Cord or ſome Covering of Clothes call'd <hi>Libonges,</hi> or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Women muſt go with their heads always uncover'd,
<note place="margin">Of the Women.</note> and wear four or five Clothes of <hi>Kimbi,</hi> or <hi>Sambes</hi> or <hi>Libonges</hi> ſew'd together, beneath their Waſte, before the Belly, in ſtead of a Girdle.</p>
                  <p>When a man at any time comes into a houſe, and ſits down unawares upon the corner of a Bed, wherein a man and woman have lain together, when he hath receiv'd information of his fault, he muſt go inſtantly to a Smith, which commonly ſit with their tackling under the open heaven, and tell him the cauſe of his coming, who then blows up a fire, and taking him by the little finger of his left hand, turns it over his head; then ſtriking two or three ſtrokes with his Hammer, and blowing with his mouth upon his hands put together, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces ſome words with a low voice, wherewith the promiſe unwittingly tranſgreſs'd is cleans'd. This ceremony they call <hi>Vempa-Momba,</hi> that is, <hi>A Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or Purification.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Now becauſe the word <hi>Mokiſie</hi> will ſometime be mention'd, it is neceſſary to ſhew the meaning thereof, and how they uſe it.</p>
                  <p>By the word <hi>Mokiſie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What <hi>Mokiſie</hi> fignifies.</note> they mean a natural Superſtition, and firm Perſwaſion that they have of ſomething, to which they aſcribe an inviſible power, in working good to their advantage, or evil to their prejudice and detriment, or from whom they expect to learn the knowledge of paſt or future things. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be call'd Idolatry, becauſe theſe people have no knowledge of any Deity, or Diabolical Spirit, having no particular name for the Devil, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call all <hi>Mokiſie,</hi> where they ſuppoſe an over-ruling power.</p>
                  <p>Whatever they effect by it,
<note place="margin">The vanity of the <hi>Mokiſie.</hi>
                     </note> is done by meer imagination, or if by natural means, it happens more by chance, than any knowledge they have. Any man that is ſound, and determines to live after the manner of his <hi>Mokiſie,</hi> obſerving temperance and chaſtity, takes the natural courſe to preſerve his health; but their ignorant ſtupidity aſcribes it to the operation of the <hi>Mokiſie.</hi> On the other hand, if any be ſick, and uſe means for the recovery of health, the good ſucceſs thereof the <hi>Mokiſie</hi> gets the praiſe of, although the cauſe of the ſickneſs were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd by the goodneſs and bounty of nature, or the ſtrength of his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if the perſon by the violence of the ſickneſs happen to die, they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly believe him kill'd by Sorcery, for tranſgreſſing againſt his <hi>Mokiſies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ancient uſe of this Common Cuſtom, ſeems an infallible demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the beſotted people, of the great vertue of the <hi>Mokiſies,</hi> and it confirms them not a little in their fooliſh belief, becauſe they ſee their King and the Grandees of the Countrey, make it their work.</p>
                  <p>The King hath the general ſtile of <hi>Mani-Lovango,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Why the King is call'd <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſie.</hi>
                     </note> but the people call him <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſie,</hi> becauſe he hath (as they ſay) a great power to kill any body with a word ſpeaking, and can ſpoil the whole Countrey; and prefer and put down, make rich, or poor at his pleaſure; cauſe rain; tranſhape or metamorphoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the ſhape of a beaſt, and innumerable ſuch like; which all ſerve to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his greatneſs, and ſtrike an awe into the Subjects of his Potency.</p>

<note place="margin">The higher a man is, the more <hi>Mokiſies</hi> he hath.</note> whoſe might, honor, and eſteem, grows from the ſame root.</p>
                  <p>As for example, the King's Siſter, as ſoon as ſhe hath a child, holds by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment the Village <hi>Kine</hi> for a dwelling-place, and may not eat Hogs fleſh: when the child hath attain'd age and growth, it viſits the <hi>Moanſa,</hi> and dares not eat the fruit call'd <hi>Kola</hi> with company, but onely alone: Afterwards it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the <hi>Ganga, Simeka,</hi> and then it dare eat no ſort of Poultry, but thoſe kill'd, and boyl'd by himſelf, and muſt bury the remainder; when he comes in <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſy,</hi> he hath other and more <hi>Mokiſies;</hi> and ſo in <hi>Boeka,</hi> and <hi>Kaye,</hi> till brought to the King.

                  <p>The <hi>Mokiſie Thiriko</hi> is a great Village, four miles Northward of <hi>Boary<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> wherein is a great houſe built on Pillars, reſembling a man. The <hi>Ganga</hi> of this <hi>Mokiſie,</hi> being Lord of the Village, performs every morning his Service and Ceremony, with ſome words and Conjurations; being anſwer'd in the mean time by a youth that ſtands by him; this <hi>Ganga</hi> commends to his <hi>Moki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> the health of the King; the wellfare of the Countrey; the good flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Seed; ſucceſs for the Merchants; and full Nets for Fiſhermen. All the by-ſtanders, at the mentioning the King's long life and health, clap their hands, in token of their affections and aſſent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mokiſie</hi> of <hi>Boeſy-batta,</hi> hath many ſtanding round about him,
<note place="margin">Mokiſie, Boeſy-batta.</note> when he ſets himſelf to his Devotion, <hi>viz.</hi> Drummers, Singers, Dancers, and the like; but he chiefly wears a four-ſquare Pouch of a Lions skin, ty'd round about with a wicker thread, and above with a Collar of Leather, ſo hanging about his neck. In this Budget, they have all ſorts of Implements a man can think on,
<note place="margin">A maſter of Slaves.</note> at leaſt that may eaſily be gotten, as all ſorts of little Horns, Shells, ſmall Stones, Iron Bells, dry'd Sprigs of Trees, Herbs, Feathers, Gums, Roots, Seeds, Keys, Patches, Shreds, Gratings, Scrapings, Horns, Teeth, Hair, and Nails of white little Dwarfs, call'd <hi>Doend us.</hi> In brief, cram'd with a whole Pedlars Pack, and dreſs'd with Feathers, Strings, Cords, Snips of Cloth, and the like.</p>
                  <p>To this they add, two Baskets thick cover'd with Shells, Feathers, Iron Hooks, and an Herb fetcht from a far diſtant Mountain; in which they cut a hole where they pour in Wine, of which they give often to drink.</p>
                  <p>The ſimplicity of the <hi>Maujeres</hi> deſerves well to be laugh'd at, for when they bring any thing upon the account of Trade, into another Countrey from home, perhaps forty or fifty miles, they muſt have ſuch a Sack of Trumpery, which ſometimes weighs ten or-twelve pounds, aloft upon their Pack, though the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it ſelf makes them ready to ſink under it; But they ſay, that it rather takes from, than adds to their carriage; whereby it appears, what effects the ſtrength of imagination can do.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremonies of their Publick Devotions are ſtrange and ridiculous,
<note place="margin">How the ſervice of theſe <hi>Mokiſies</hi> is perform'd.</note> for in the firſt place they bring forth a Bag of Jewels; then the <hi>Ganga</hi> ſits down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Mat, and with a Leather Bag, thumps upon his Knee, having always ſome little Iron Bells betwixt his fingers; then again he ſtrikes upon his breaſt, and paints with red and white upon his Eye-lids; Body and Face, uſing many ſtrange motions and poſtures of their Body, Hands, Head and Eyes; now raiſing the voice to a high pitch, then depreſſing it, frequently ſpeaking the word <hi>Mariomena;</hi> whereupon, thoſe that ſit round about, with all the reſt of the aſſembly anſwer <hi>Ka.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this hath continu'd a great ſpace, the <hi>Ganga</hi> or Conjurer begins to turn his Eyes, and look as if he were diſtracted, ſo that they muſt hold him; but by vertue of a fowr Water, or Juyce drawn from Cane, wherewith they ſprinkle him; recovering, he tells what he hath receiv'd from <hi>Boeſy-batta,</hi> and what muſt be done in ſuch and ſuch caſes; as of theft, ſickneſs, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, they uſe ſo many other Cheats and Deluſions, that if we ſhould but name them, would ſwell to a bulk too Voluminous for our Deſign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lykokoo,</hi> is a black Woodden Image, cut in the ſhape of a Man ſitting; and in <hi>Kinga,</hi> a Town lying by the Sea-Coaſt, where they have a common Burial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, they recite a thouſand ridiculous Rhymes concerning this <hi>Kikokoo;</hi> As,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:56692:324"/>That he preſerves them from Death;
<note place="margin">Sorcerers, or <hi>Doojes.</hi>
                     </note> That he keeps them from hurt by Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, or <hi>Doojes,</hi> as they call them; That he makes the Dead ariſe out of the Graves in the Night, and forces them to labor, by going to the Shore, and helping to catch Fiſh, and to drive the <hi>Canoos</hi> in the Water, and in the Day hunts them to their Graves again; and the like Fictions, which the elder Folks make the young believe, and imprint it in them from their Infancy.</p>
                  <p>It happ'ned once formerly, that ſome Mariners of a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ship, that went to <hi>Lovango,</hi> in the Night ſtole <hi>Kikokoo</hi> out of his Houſe, and brought it on Board, and in the way an Arm and the Head brake off: But having occaſions afterwards to go to <hi>Lovango</hi> again, they durſt not venture thither, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring <hi>Kikokoo:</hi> So nailing the Head and Arm again faſt to the Trunk, and being come upon the Road, they ſet him in the dead of the Night into his Houſe again. The next day there aroſe a Report among the <hi>Blacks,</hi> That <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kokoo</hi> was in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that a Ship with Goods had taken him away. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there came by miſhap a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ship to ſtrike upon the Rocks of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vango,</hi> whereupon they cried, That <hi>Kikokoo</hi> had broken the Ship, becauſe the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> had driven a Nail into his Head. Thus they are taught at every turn to defend the Honor of the <hi>Moquiſies,</hi> and to miſapply every Accident, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their Folly.</p>
                  <p>When the Bonfires of <hi>Bomba</hi> are made, they lay many Drums upon the ground, which they beat with their hands and feet, ſitting round about a Poſt that is ſet in the middle; among which the Daughters of <hi>Kimbos-bombos</hi> all dance, moving their Bodies, Eyes, and Head, like mad Folks; and with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene Poſtures, ſing certain Verſes, wearing upon their Heads a Buſh of all ſorts of colour'd Feathers, and on their Bodies ſtrange faſhion'd Garments, with a red and white painted Rattle in each Hand. In brief, The more apiſhly they behave themſelves, the freer and braver they are eſteem'd to be. A thouſand more ridiculous and beſtial Ceremonies theſe ſhameleſs <hi>Gangaes</hi> practice at their Bonfires, mocking their <hi>Moquiſies,</hi> and dare do whatſoever they think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>

                     <hi>Malemba</hi> is a <hi>Moquiſie</hi> of great eſteem, and ſerves to ſupport the King's Health.

Afterwards ſome Painting of <hi>Takoel</hi> and Holy-water, taken out of a Pot with a Bruſh, is ſprinkled upon the <hi>Ganga's</hi> and King's Body, with a Song of Probation ſerving to the purpoſe. Alſo the Nobility, which peep, have for their pains, out of the ſame Pot, a red Streak put upon their Bodies, and have afterwards the Honor to carry away <hi>Malemba,</hi> with his Pots, Bruſhes, and Cans, and to hang them in their Places.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Moquiſie Kymaye</hi> is a Town cloſe by <hi>Boarye,</hi>

The <hi>Ganga</hi> plays with the Jugling-Box, painted white, knocks with a new Cap full of Stones, blows in his Hands, ſtrikes his Arms and Navel, ſits upon a Skin, and is a rare Phyſician for thoſe that are well. He makes it rain (ſurely a ſtrange thing!) in <hi>December, January, February, March, April,</hi> nay till <hi>May.</hi> He takes care of the Sea, Fiſhery, <hi>Canoos,</hi> and for other things, accompting himſelf a <hi>Kykokas</hi> Fellow.</p>

                  <p>The Natives in general are a nimble,
<note place="margin">Conſtitution of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</note> active, and well-ſhap'd People, climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the craggy Mountains with notable agility.</p>
                  <p>They take little care for their Living, and dare undertake any thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apprehenſion or fear of Danger; among themſelves unanimous; to Strangers, with whom converſing, upright and true-hearted: but they have, by reaſon of their Beaſtial Nature, little Trade with the <hi>Whites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their common Food is Mens Fleſh;
<note place="margin">Food.</note> inſomuch that their Markets are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with that, as ours in <hi>Europe</hi> with Beef or Mutton: All Priſoners of Wars, unleſs they can ſell them alive with greater advantage; otherwiſe, as we ſaid, they fatten them for Slaughter, and at laſt ſell them to Butchers, to accommodate the Markets.</p>
                  <p>To this Savage Barbarity they are ſo naturaliz'd, that ſome Slaves, whether as weary of their Lives, or to ſhew their Love to their Maſters, will proffer themſelves freely to be kill'd and eaten. But that which is moſt inhumane, and beyond the ferity of Beaſts, is, that the Father matters not to eat his Son, nor the Son his Father, nor one Brother the other; but take them by force, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring their Fleſh, the Blood yet reeking hot between their Teeth. Laſtly, Whoſoever dies, be the Diſeaſe never ſo contagious, yet they eat the Fleſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, as a Feſtival Diſh.</p>
                  <p>The Habit of the common ſort of Men differs not much from what before deſcribed;
<note place="margin">Apparel.</note> for they go with the upper part of their Bodies naked, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing on their heads: but People of Quality have Clothes of Silk or Cloth, and on their Heads red or black Caps, of their own making, or elſe <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Flannel Bonnets.</p>
                  <p>The Noble and other Women of Quality, cover themſelves from Head to Foot with Mantles; but the common Women wear only a Cloth hanging down, girt about their Middle, and without Shooes.</p>
                  <p>The Men may keep as many Wives and Concubines as they pleaſe;
<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> but the Teeming Women after their Delivery, take no care to breed up their Children, but kill them and eat them up immediately.</p>
                  <p>They have neither Houſes, Goods, Towns, or ſettled Dwelling-places; but rove like the wild <hi>Arabs,</hi> or barbarous <hi>Scythians,</hi> from place to place, neither Sowing nor Mowing, but living wholly by Rapine and Pillage, eating the Fruits of other Mens Labors, where-ever they come, devouring and ſpoiling all before them.</p>
                  <p>Their Language differs wholly from the <hi>Congiſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Language.</note> which they endeavor to learn and become very expert in, though they make little uſe thereof, in regard of their Savage and unconverſible Natures.</p>
                  <p>In ſtead of Money,
<note place="margin">Money.</note> they uſe <hi>Simbos;</hi> or little Horns, as thoſe of <hi>Lovando,</hi> with whom they drive a great Trade, carrying thither Slaves and Ivory, which they exchange for theſe Horns, Salt, Silk, Glaſs-Diſhes, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <pb n="519" facs="tcp:56692:325"/>
                  <p>Their Arms (for they love War) are ſhort Wooden Bowes,
<note place="margin">Arms.</note> cover'd with divers colour'd Snake-skins, that they ſeem to be made of one piece; which they do to ſtrengthen, and that they may hold it the faſter in their Hands. They make theſe Weapons of a kind of tough black Canes, which prove very laſting and ſerviceable. The Arrows are ſhort, light, and thin, made of hard Wood, which they commonly hold together with the Bowe in their Hands: In the uſe whereof, for Shooting, they have ſo great dexterity, that they can diſcharge eight and twenty Arrows before the firſt falls to the Ground, and can kill a Bird flying. Beſides theſe, they uſe alſo a ſort of Pole-axes, whoſe Handle having a Knob at the end, is cover'd with Snakes-skins: The Head ſhines very bright, being faſtned in the Wood with Copper Pins, and like thoſe in uſe ſometimes among us, hath at one end a ſharp Edge like a Hatchet, and at the other a Hammer. In Fighting, they defend themſelves from the Enemies Arrows with the flat Sides thereof, in ſtead of a Shield, and turn every way with ſuch readineſs, that they void all the Shafts aimed at them.</p>
                  <p>They wear alſo Ponyards in Scabbards of Serpents-skins, in Belts of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants-hides, three Fingers broad, and two thick. Some have Shields made of Wood, cover'd with the Skin of the Beaſt <hi>Dant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They worſhip the Sun, as their chief Deity, in the Shape of a Man;
<note place="margin">Religion.</note> next to that the Moon, in the Figure of a Woman: But beſides theſe, every one hath his peculiar Idol. When they go to Battel, they ſacrifice to their Idol, out of which their Devil ſpeaks very plain, and tells them what they muſt do.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anzikos</hi> live under a peculiar King, call'd the Great <hi>Makoko,</hi>

                  <p>There are at preſent no <hi>Jages</hi> to be found of the firſt Race; but thoſe that now aſſume that Name, derive their Extract out of the ſeveral Countreys wherein they have Warred, and been Victorious, being choſen thereto in this manner.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as they have won a Battel,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Jages</hi> how they are bred.</note> they ſearch among the Priſoners for the handſomeſt Youths, of whoſe Courage they make tryal, by ſhooting at them, by, and over their Heads: Wherein if any diſcover a fear of the Arrows, as Cowards, and unfit for Service, they knock on the Head, and eat; but thoſe that appear fearleſs and undaunted, they make holes through their Noſes and Ears, knock out their Fore-teeth, and ſo bring them up to all Savage Cruelty; who by practice at laſt ſtray ſo far from Humanity, that they exceed the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Jages.</hi> Theſe poſſeſs not only this Countrey of <hi>Anſiko,</hi> but wander almoſt through all <hi>Africa;</hi> although now they have their chief Reſidence here, and in the South-Eaſt of <hi>Angola.</hi>

                     <p>At Noon the King cauſeth all the Noble-men, then in the Bounds of the Palace, to be numbred: Whereupon all the Pots are brought before them, one with boyl'd Beans, another with Fleſh, and a third with <hi>Mille,</hi> without any Spicery but Salt, and ſome Oyl of Palm. To the greateſt Lords he ſends every one his Part, in a Wooden Platter, together with a ſmall Flask of Palm-Wine: But thoſe of leſs Quality are by Name call'd up, and Accommodated by ſix, ſeven, or eight together, to whom the King directs ſuch a great Pot of <hi>Mille,</hi> Beans, or Fleſh, according to their Number.</p>
                     <p>After the Feaſt is ended, they come all into the King's Preſence, and falling upon their Knees, clap their Hands, and bow their Heads, in token of Thanks and Submiſſion, and ſo depart to their own Homes; onely ſome Favorites ſtay all the day long, and drink ſo much Tobacco and Wine of Palm, that every one, as well the King as Nobles, are ſo highly fluſter'd, that they cannot go from the Place.</p>
                     <p>When the King goes abroad,
<note place="margin">With what State he goes abroad.</note> not only the Nobility, but alſo thoſe that dwell about the Court, or by occaſion are found there at that time, attend him; ſome going before, others following; but all dancing and tumbling with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Poſtures, to the Muſick of certain ill-tun'd Drums, and long Ivory Flutes like Cornets, until the King be within his Houſe.</p>
                     <p>At the King's going to Church, preſently, as ſoon as he is come without the Palace, not onely his own Grandees, which at all times are ready, but alſo the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> as well Temporality as Clergy, muſt wait upon him, and again from the Church to his Palace; but at no other time are the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> oblig'd to ſuch Attendance.</p>
                     <p>When he ſheweth himſelf openly to the People, he is always attired in his richeſt Robes, that is, a great long Mantle or Cloak, of Silk, Velvet, or fine Cloth, moſt ſplendidly beautifi'd: On his Fingers he hath ſome Gold Chains, intermixt with fine Coral; and upon his Head, a bordered and preciouſly adorned Cap.</p>
                     <p>He hath in his Palace about a hundred Waiters, who all have Lodgings in the Court.

<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſent to the King in Embaſſy.</note> came the firſt time to the King, as Ambaſſadors from <hi>Lovando Sante Paulo,</hi> immediately after they had forced it from the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> they got Audience at the Evening, in the Dark, paſſing through a Gallery two hundred Paces long, ſet on both ſides with two Ranks of Men, with Wax Candles in their Hands burning.</p>
                     <p>The King ſate in a ſmall Chappel, hang'd with Ruſh Mats,
<note place="margin">The State of the King.</note> from the top of which a Branch hung with Wax Candles; Habited in a Cloth of Gold Coat and Drawers, and about his neck three heavy Gold Chains: He had on his right Thumb a very large Granate or Ruby Ring, and on his left Hand two great Emeraulds; upon the left Sleeve of his Coat, a Gold Croſs was faſtned, richly enclos'd in a piece of well-poliſh'd Cryſtal: On his Head a fine white Cap, and on his Legs a pair of Ruſſet Boots. At his right ſide ſtood an Officer, that ſometime gently fanned the Air with a Handkerchief; and at his left ſide another, holding a Tin Bowe, and a Tin Scepter, cover'd with fine ſtrip'd Cloth in his Hand. His Seat a red Velvet <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Chair, aloft above which, upon a Border, was embroider'd in Letters, <hi>Don Alvarez King of Congo.</hi> Right before him lay ſpread a great <hi>Turkey</hi> Carpet, and over his Head hung a Canopy of white Sattin, ſet with Gold, and trimm'd about with a deep Fringe. A little on the right ſide kneeled before him <hi>Don Bernardo de Menzos,</hi> his Interpreter and Secretary.</p>
                     <p>The King's Apparel is very glorious and rich,
<note place="margin">His Cloathing.</note> being for the moſt part Cloth of Gold or Silver, with a long Velvet Mantle.</p>
                     <p>This King wears commonly a white Cap upon his Head;
<note place="margin">He wears a white Cap.</note> ſo do his <hi>Fidal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes,</hi> or Nobility, in his Favour: And this is indeed ſo eminent a token thereof, that if the King be diſpleaſed with any of them, he onely cauſes his Cap to be taken off from his Head: For this white Cap is a Cognizance of Nobility or Knighthood here, as in <hi>Europe</hi> every Order hath a peculiar Badge to diſtinguiſh it.</p>

                     <p>When the King goeth abroad with all his Nobles adorn'd with white Caps on their Heads,
<note place="margin">When the King is deſirous to have Taxes, he lets his Cop blow off.</note> he ſometimes puts on a Hat, and at pleaſure lays that aſide, and reſumes his Cap, which he then puts very looſely on, upon ſet purpoſe that the Wind ſhould blow it off the eaſier; which according to deſign hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, his <hi>Fidalgoes</hi> run to take it up, and bring it to the King again: but the King as offended at the Diſgrace, will not receive the ſame, but goeth home very much troubled; the next day he ſends two or three hundred <hi>Blacks</hi> abroad to gather in Taxes; ſo puniſhing his whole Kingdom, for the offence of the Wind in blowing off his Cap, which he cauſed of ſet purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>He hath one Married Wife,
<note place="margin">The Queen is call'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni-mombada.</hi>
                        </note> which they call <hi>Mani-Mombada,</hi> that is <hi>Queen;</hi> all the reſt,
<note place="margin">Taxes for the Queen, how rais'd.</note> being no ſmall number, are Concubines. For this Wife a Yearly Tax is gathered through the whole Kingdom, by them call'd <hi>Pintelſo;</hi> every Houſe paying a Rate for their Beds, <hi>viz.</hi> a Slave for every Spans breadth: ſo that if it be three Spans broad, they pay three Slaves.</p>
                     <p>The Queen hath her Lodgings in the Palace,
<note place="margin">Her place of aboad.</note> apart, with her Ladies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which have little Courtſhip or Art to ſet them forth; yet they go almoſt every night abroad to take their pleaſure, and to ſatisfie their wanton deſires; onely ſome ſtay according to their turns to wait upon the Queen, who will her ſelf, if ſhe finds a convenient opportunity, and a Perſon that dares venture to come in the Night over the Straw Walls into the Court, to her private Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not be backward to receive their proffer'd Kindneſs: But this ſhe doth with great circumſpection; for if the King ſhould hear of it, it would endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger both their Lives.</p>
                     <p>The King, on the contrary, keeps as many Concubines as he pleaſes; as well of the Ladies of Honor belonging to the Queen, as of others, without check: but the Prieſts ſpare not to reprove him for it openly in their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>When the King dies, his Relations put him into the Grave in a Sitting Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, to whom formerly a dozen young Maids leap'd out of free choice, and were buried alive, to ſerve him in the other Life, as believing, That he ſhould not remain dead, but go into that other World, and live there. Theſe Maids were then ſo earneſt and deſirous of this Service to their deceaſed Prince, that for eagerneſs to be firſt, they kill'd one another. And their Parents and Friends gather together all ſorts of ſtately Clothes, and put them into the Grave, to the intent that when they arrive in that ſtrange Countrey, they may buy ſuch things as they have occaſion for therewith.</p>
                     <p>The Funeral of the King, in ſtead of other Mourning, is celebrated eight days together with continual Eating and Drinking; and this kind of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they call <hi>Malala,</hi> and every Year after Solemnize it with an Anniverſary-Meeting in the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>This Cuſtom is not only us'd for the King, but alſo for the Nobility, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Quality, and continues to this day; but by the progreſs of Chriſtianity, teaching better things, they have laid aſide totally the burying of People alive.</p>
                     <p>In the Succeſſion to the Crown they obſerve no Order;
<note place="margin">Inheritance of the Crown</note> neither Legitimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor Seniority taking place further than the Ruling Grandees pleaſe; they, according to the humor of barbarous Nations, eſteeming all alike Honorable: For which reaſon the Nobles chuſe one out of the King's Sons (whether Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate or Illegitimate it matters not) for whom they have the moſt reſpect, or think the fitteſt; or elſe perhaps ſometimes ſway'd by extravagant Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:56692:340"/>relinquiſh all the Children, and give the Crown to a Brother or Nephew.</p>
                     <p>The Coronation of the King they Solemnize after this manner.
<note place="margin">The manner of the King's Coronation.</note> All the Nobles and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> aſſemble before the Palace, in a four-ſquare open Court, built for that purpoſe of old, encompaſs'd with a ſlight Stone Wall about five Yards high; in the middle of which ſtands a great Velvet Chair and a Cuſhion, with a ſtately Carpet ſpread before it, and a Crown wrought of Gold, Silk and Silver-Wyre laid thereon; as alſo three Gold Armlets, about the thickneſs of a Finger, and a Velvet Purſe, wherein is the Pope's Bull, or Letters of Confirmation to the new King.</p>
                     <p>The intended King after ſome time comes into this Congregation, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the Nobleſs concern'd primarily in the Election; where all things prepared, there ſtands one up, which in the nature of a Herald proclaims theſe words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>You that ſhall be King, be no Thief, neither covetous nor revengeful; but be a friend of the Poor: You ſhall beſtow the Alms for the releaſement of Priſoners or Slaves, and help the Needy, and be charitable to the Church, and always endeavour to keep this Kingdom in Peace and Quietneſs, and fully obſerve and keep the ſame without breach of League with your Brother the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this Speech ended, the Muſick begins to play with excellent Melody; which having continued a convenient ſeaſon, the laſt two <hi>Fidalgo's</hi> go ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeek him amongſt the People, the remaining part of them ſitting upon the Ground. Theſe two in a ſhort time find him they ſought for, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him one by the right Arm, and the other by the left, place him upon the foremention'd Royal Chair, and put the Crown upon his Head, on his Arms the Gold Armlets, and the uſual black Cloth, or Bayze-Cloak, upon his Body; then he lays his Hand upon a Maſs-Book and the Evangeliſts, which the Prieſt holds to him, Clothed in a white Garment, hung with white Taſſels, and the King ſwears to do and keep all that he hath been forewarned of, by him the formention'd Herald. After the ending of theſe Solemnities, the twelve Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and the King go to the Palace, accompanied with all thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Coronation, who caſt Earth and Sand upon him, for a Token of rejoycing, and for an Admonition, that though he be now King, he ſhall be Duſt and Aſhes.</p>
                     <p>The King after his Crowning remains eight days in his Palace, never going forth; in which time all the <hi>Black</hi> Nobility, none excepted, and all the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> come to viſit and wiſh him good ſucceſs: the <hi>Blacks</hi> do him a kind of Homage, lying down upon both Knees, clapping their hands, and kiſſing the King's Hand: the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſit kneeling upon one Knee, and ſo the Prieſts and Clergy, by that humble poſture acknowledging his Soveraignty.</p>
                     <p>After the eight days paſt the King appears in the Market, and makes a Speech to the People, expreſſing his readineſs for the performing of that which was propounded to him, with aſſurance to them, that he will ſeek nothing more than the quiet and welfare of his Kingdoms and Subjects, and the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith.</p>
                     <p>The People of <hi>Congo,</hi> take the Oath of Fidelity to their King, like other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but forget it quickly, Murdering him upon any ſleight occaſion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Inſurrections or Treaſon; ſo that within theſe forty or fifty years they have had many Kings: for if all things go not to their minds, or if it Rains too much or too little, or if any other accident happens, the King bears the blame.</p>

                        </note> routed the King's Army, and took him Priſoner; ſo that for his releaſe and reſtoration to his Kingdom, he was forced to give to the Earl two Territories, the one a Principality, call'd <hi>Mokata,</hi> a great Land of Tillage, lying where the River <hi>Zair</hi> bordereth neareſt to <hi>Songo.</hi> Yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Quarrel was renew'd, and Forces on both ſides drawn into the Field,
<note place="margin">A ſecond Overthrow.</note> and the Controverſie coming to be decided by the Sword, the King loſt the Day, and together with it many Slaves. Theſe two Victories exceedingly puffed up the Earl. It was imputed to the King as a great miſcarriage, that this laſt he drew into the Field with a ſmall Force, whereas he hath innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble People under his Command: but this overſight he quickly amended, and hath taken ſevere revenge of the <hi>Songo's</hi> for the Loſſes formerly received.

<note place="margin">A new War.</note> for the old Earl being dead, in the Year Sixteen hundred forty and one, there aroſe a new and bloody War between the King and the Earl <hi>Don Daniel du Silva,</hi> ariſing upon this ground: When after the
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:56692:341"/>Deceaſe of <hi>Don Michael,</hi> who Rul'd about the Year Sixteen hundred and ſix, his Son, the foremention'd <hi>Don Daniel du Silva,</hi> could not come to ſucceed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Faction rais'd againſt him was too ſtrong, he fled to the Duke of <hi>Bamba;</hi> in whoſe Court he remain'd a long time: but at laſt, by the help of his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, got the poſſeſſion of his Inheritance, and burning with revenge for his ſufferings and diſgrace, he gave occaſion of Quarrel, by refuſing to requeſt of the King of <hi>Congo,</hi> according to the old Cuſtom, the confirmation of his Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, firſt accuſing him as one that had a hand in his long Expulſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall adding, that the Election of his Subjects did enough confirm him in his Government, and therefore he needed no other. The King of <hi>Congo</hi> enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hereat, and accounting it a great diſ-reputation and diminution to his Royal Authority, to be ſo Bearded, as a manifeſtation of his high diſpleaſure, placed his Son, the Prince <hi>Don Alphonſo,</hi> in the Principality of <hi>Makata,</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, as we have ſaid, to the Earl of <hi>Songo,</hi> for releaſing of the King <hi>Don Alvarez,</hi> giving him in charge not onely to keep it, but from thence to make War upon the Earl.

                     <p>The King by this overthrow provoked more than ever to take revenge, raiſed in the following Year ſo great a Force, that he doubted not therewith to over-run the whole Earldom at once: Of this Army, conſiſting of almoſt all the Nobility, together with three or four hundred <hi>Moulatto's,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bamba</hi> was made General, and therewith drew near to the Borders of <hi>Songo;</hi> but was unawares fall'n upon by an Ambuſcade out of the Wood <hi>Emtinda Guola,</hi> on the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> and his Army not onely totally defeated,

                     <p>The <hi>Congo's</hi> King finding himſelf too weak to withſtand his Enemies, by the Counſel of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſent an Agent to <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> then King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> praying his Aid; who immediately ſent him a Supply by Shipping of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Soldiers: In which Expedition many Nobles and Reformado's put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Service, under the Command of <hi>Don Francis de Govea,</hi> a Man who had often been in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> who after a fortunate Voyage arriving at <hi>St. Thomas Iſle,</hi> where by Order they put in for Recruits of Ammunition, and to Victual and refreſh, they went over to <hi>Congo,</hi> and Landed at <hi>Horſe-Iſland,</hi> where the King of <hi>Congo</hi> then had his abode; where the General having received new Supplies of <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and <hi>Congo's,</hi> went over to the Main Land, and Fought the <hi>Jages,</hi> beating them in divers Battels; inſomuch that <hi>Alvarez,</hi> after a year and a halfs exile, was reſtor'd to his Realm.</p>
                     <p>The King being thus re-ſetled in his Throne, required for the eſtabliſhing of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, that Prieſts might be ſent thither; and as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of this Aid and Aſſiſtance, he obliged himſelf by a Written Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſend yearly a Preſent of Slaves, and withall to own him as his Lord: The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> refuſed the ſame, modeſtly returning, <hi>That he acknowledged the King of</hi> Congo <hi>for his Brother at Arms;</hi> but anſwer'd his Deſire for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.

                     <p>The Cure, which immediately muſt be uſed upon the appearance of the Symptomes, they perform by waſhing the Fundament very clean, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Pill made of a quarter of a rinded Lemmon therein, with the Finger holding it in as long as may well be endur'd; which is not done without great pain and burning, a ſign of the right <hi>Bitios.</hi> This Medicine, though ſeeming but mean, yet proves the onely Remedy againſt this Diſeaſe, if time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied: But if the Diſtemper be grown inveterate, and far rooted (which the ſwelling out and opening of the end of the Gut, and a whitiſh looſneſs teſtifies) then a Mixture of Juyce of Tobacco-leaves, Salt, and Vinegar, ſteeped together two hours, then ſtamped in a Mortar, and ſo much thereof put into the Fundament as can well be done, and kept there as long as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, reduces the Part again to its proper condition, and abſolutely cures the Diſeaſe.

                     <p>The <hi>Bitios</hi> alſo are cured by frequent Clyſters, or Serringing the Fundament-Guts with the purified Decoction of the Plant <hi>Orore de Bitos,</hi> and dried Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:56692:349"/>mixt, with one or two Yelks of Eggs, and a little Allom, and Oyl of Roſes.

                     <p>This Labor at firſt was ill reſented by the Inhabitants, who were drawn to it with great difficulty; but when they taſted the Profit, and ſaw the Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, every one ſought to get a Plantation, and took ſo much Ground as they could Manure. In this manner the Ground was planted with <hi>Mille,</hi> Beans, and all ſorts of Herbage; and by Time and Practice the People ſtill improving, became not onely a neceſſary Plantation, but as it were a pleaſant Garden for the whole Countrey. But afterwards, in the Year Sixteen hundred forty one, when the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> took the City <hi>Lovando Saint Paulo,</hi> all was burn'd and ruin'd: So that this Tract of Land, formerly, as we ſaid, a Garden of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, became afterwards a Den for Lions, Tygers, and other wild Beaſts: However, after ſome time a Peace being ſettled between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> their joynt Endeavors reſtor'd it to the former Beauty and Fertility.</p>

                     <p>In the Planting and uſing <hi>Mandikoka</hi> they practice this method: After the Earth is prepared, by being well wrought, beaten ſmall, and thrown up in Hills like Mole-hills, little Twigs or Slips cut off from the Branches of it, about a Foot long, and an Inch thick, are ſet ſloaping one againſt another, on every Hill two or three Sticks, with the ends about a Hand-breadth above the Earth; which immediately take Root, and in nine, ten, or twelve Moneths, ſhoot up to the heighth of twelve Foot, with many Branches, and a Body as big as a Man's Thigh: Then to make the Root grow large, the Ground muſt be Weeded two or three times, and kept clean: And when it is grown to its perfect maturity, they cut the Stemm cloſe to the Earth, being good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Fewel; but the ſmall Boughs they fit for the next Planting,
<note place="margin">How the Root <hi>Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koka</hi> is ground to Meal.</note> and ſo from time to time. Afterwards the Root being digg'd up, and the Shell taken from they make it <hi>Farina,</hi> by Grinding it in a Mill made like the Wheels of a Waggon, but a Span broad upon the Soal, Shod with Copper; in which are made many ſharp Points in manner of a Grater, and underneath a Trough, into which the Meal falls.

                     <p>For this work many Houſes are built, above a hundred Foot long, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or forty Foot broad; wherein on both ſides ſtand the Furnances, that is, on each ſide ten, and three Mills unfixt, and movable upon occaſion from place to place.

The Houſes of the Nobility have Rooms jetting out, incloſing a Court, and an outward place of Receipt.</p>
                     <p>Their Muſick muſt needs be very mean and harſh, having but one ſort of Inſtrument, call'd a <hi>Cas,</hi> made Basket-faſhion of the Stock of the <hi>Palmito</hi>-Tree, Carved in Flowers, and cover'd with a Board, which being ſtruck yields a Taboring ſound.</p>

                     <p>The Men, as we ſaid before, may have as many Wives as they can feed,
<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> and the firſt is accounted the ſuperior of all, if Married according to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> manner.</p>
                     <p>A Woman, as long her Children have no Teeth, keeps from her Husband; but as ſoon as it hath any, all the Friends and Acquaintance, both Men and Women, carries it in their Arms from Houſe to Houſe, Playing and Singing, to receive a Gift for it, and ſeldom or never are put off with a denial.</p>
                     <p>When any Perſon dies, they wind up the Corps, being firſt waſhed clean,

<note place="margin">The puniſhment of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</note> the Offender, together with his Wife and Children, and their whole Stock, are made Slaves to the <hi>Sova's.</hi> But ſometimes they accuſe not one another, but work their own revenge, by poyſoning of their Adverſary.</p>
                     <p>In the Enquiry they take no care whether the Party be guilty, or puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indeed, but the Saying of the <hi>Sova's,</hi> or Averment of one ſingle perſon, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Cauſe.</p>

                     <p>None of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> may bring thoſe Clothes into <hi>Lovando,</hi> but onely the Factor of the Merchant who dwells at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and ſent thither to buy them up, whereof he makes no ſmall Gain.</p>
                     <p>Out of <hi>Benyn</hi> come blue Cotton-Clothes, by them call'd <hi>Mouponoqua,</hi> but by the <hi>Portugueſe, Panos res gatto de Berre;</hi> they are five Clothes together, and a a Yard and a half, or two yards broad.

                     <p>Theſe Slaves get but little Food on the Way, and lie on the bare Ground every Night under the open Heaven, without any other Covering, by which means they grow poor and faint: but the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> in <hi>Lovando,</hi> before they Ship them away, bring them firſt into a great Houſe, which they have built there for that purpoſe, and give them their fill of Meat and Drink, and likewiſe Palm-Oyl to refreſh and anoint themſelves withall: But if it happen that there be no Ships ready, or that they have not Slaves enough to ſend away, then they uſe them for tilling the Ground, and to plant or cut <hi>Mandihoka:</hi> but at laſt when they put them on Board, they take great care to preſerve them from Sickneſs; and that they may come ſafe and ſound to their intended Port, provide Medicines, eſpecially Lemons and white Lead, to uſe againſt the <hi>Bitios;</hi> and if by chance any fall ſick, they ſeparate him from the reſt, and lay him alone to be Cured, where he is well provided for with warm Diet.</p>
                     <p>In the Ships they have Mats to lie on; of which they take great ſtore with them, eſpecially when they go over to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> to give every ten or twelves days a freſh Mat.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> take no ſuch care in tranſporting their Slaves to <hi>Brazile,</hi> but ſtrip them poor and faint, without any Proviſion of Mats or other things, by which means many die at Sea.</p>
                     <p>In the Village <hi>Kambamba</hi> the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> deal for many Slaves, but not ſo much as in <hi>Maſsingan</hi> and <hi>Embakko;</hi> for there when the adjacent <hi>Blacks</hi> want any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, they bring their Slaves to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Colonies for exchange.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Faire-Bay.</note> becauſe the Sea hath waſh'd into the Shore in ſuch a manner, that it ſeems to be a great Lake rather than a Bay, containing many Iſlands and Havens; and amongſt others, <hi>Ilehos Ctaos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Between theſe are three <hi>Capes</hi> plac'd in the Maps, <hi>viz. Cabo de Sante Franſisko, Cabo das Sorras,</hi> and <hi>Cabo do Aregito,</hi> and an Iſle call'd, <hi>The Iſland of Content.</hi>

                     <p>As to the Air, quality of the Soyl, Plants, Beaſts, Cuſtoms, Food, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Arms, Language, Religion and Worſhip, of this people in general; we cannot ſay much, that little we ſhall ſpeak, will have onely relation to the <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentots,</hi> lying cloſe to the <hi>Cape,</hi> as the <hi>Garouchouquas, Goringhuiquas, Goringhaiconas, Cochoquas,</hi> or <hi>Saldanhans,</hi> great and little <hi>Cariguriquas,</hi> and <hi>Hoſaas;</hi> for of the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Vanouquas, Cabonas, Sonquas, Mamaquas, Heuſaquas, Brigoudys, Hancumquas,</hi> hitherto little or no information hath been had, other than that in general they agree with thoſe that lie neareſt to the <hi>Cape.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Air about the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Good-Hope</hi> is always Serene,
<note place="margin">Air.</note> Clear, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and by conſequence very Healthy, becauſe neither the Heat parches, nor the Cold pierces too much. In <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> blow the ſtiffeſt and ſharpeſt ſtorms of Wind from the Southerly Points, which continue till <hi>December,</hi> mix'd with Miſts, Snow and Froſt; ſo that the waters in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> are often Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen the thickneſs of the back of a Knife.</p>
                     <p>The Vale-Winds,
<note place="margin">Wind.</note> or Hurricans, blow ſometimes ſo terribly from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which are commonly cover'd with thick Clouds, which hover there, and break with that violence, as if all above ground would be rent to pieces. At this time, when the Winds bluſter and tear ſo horribly, they make a hollow Sea at the Point, which too often proves dangerous for Ships.</p>
                     <p>It Rains there in the Winter, that is, in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June,</hi> ſo extreamly, as if it did almoſt pour down, whereby the low grounds are laid under Water, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice; for after the falling away of the Water, the ground appears more freſh and flouriſhing.</p>
                     <p>The Soyl about the <hi>Cape,</hi> is in ſome places very rich and ferile, fit to be Husbanded, and to produce all manner of Fruits; although other parts be full of Clay, Stony, Gravelly, or Sandy: ſome Trees grow here and there, but ſo hard and knotty, as makes them fit onely for Fuel: yet the natives report, that in the Countrey there grow ſuch Trees, that a hundred men may ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under one of them; perhaps the Indian Fig-Tree, by <hi>Linſchot</hi> call'd <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar de Rais.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There grow in the Winter,
<note place="margin">Plants.</note> eſpecially among the <hi>Saldanhars,</hi> certain little roots which they eat; ſome of them have a taſte like Anniſeeds, others like <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>-Artichokes, others as Acorns.</p>
                     <p>The Valleys and Plains under, lie verdur'd with Graſs and ſweet Herbs, which being boyl'd with freſh Meat, make a pleaſant Sallet.</p>

                     <p>There grow wild upon the Mountains, and in the Valleys, and on the banks of the Rivers, many other ſorts of Plants; as among the reſt a peculiar ſort of Tulips, <hi>Sempervive, Fritillaria,</hi> or Speckled Lillies, Penny-Wort, or Dragon-Wort with ſharp pointed Leaves, Sorrel with knotted Roots, and white Bloſſoms.</p>
                     <p>The Tulip bears a bole bigger than ones fiſt, having thick Shells,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Cape</hi>-Tulip.</note> but of a faint ſmell. The Bloſſom that ſhoots out before the Leaves in <hi>April,</hi> of a very high red colour, appearing very gloriouſly, and hath five broad, long, and thick Leaves; within having whitiſh red Stripes, and at the end a round Stalk of a ſpan long, ſtreak'd and ſpeckled with purple upon a white ground. It grows upon the Mountains.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sempervive</hi> or Houſe-Leek, hath Leaves almoſt a finger thick, whitiſh green, and as big almoſt as the Palm of ones Hand.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fritillaria,</hi> or the ſpeckled <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> which ſome reckon as a ſort of <hi>Denti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laria,</hi> or <hi>Eminie;</hi> hath in ſtead of Leaves, Sprouts of a fingers length, thick and juicy, with ſharp and round broken edges like Teeth, of a pale purple above, and underneath green: At the Leaves comes a flower that hath five limber Leaves, ſharp at the ends, with a high Crown or Tuft in the middle, hollow within, incloſing another flower, which hath alſo five Leaves, all yellow, but of a dark-brown at the ends, with ſome very red ſtandards in the middle: this Plant hath no ſmell, and grows upon barren and Sandy Mountains.</p>
                     <p>The Sorrel with knotted Roots, ſhoots up a ſpan in height, hath hard, pale green Leaves, long and ſlender, which ſtand aloft on the Stalk five or ſix toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for below the Stalk is void of Leaves.</p>
                     <p>In the very Sea it ſelf, about the <hi>Cape</hi> may be ſeen ſeveral Plants, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="588" facs="tcp:56692:368"/>upon ſight whereof, the Sea-men infallibly know they are near this Coaſt.</p>
                     <p>Alſo <hi>Sargoſſa,</hi> a kind of a Lentil, drives along, being an Herb like Sedge, or Wild-Creſſes; which are to be ſeen an hundred miles far and wide in the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Sea, driven upon heaps.</p>
                     <p>They have alſo Coral, Tortoiſe-ſhells, Pearls, and in the <hi>Salt-River</hi> pure white Salt.</p>
                     <p>About <hi>Cabo das Aiguilhas,</hi> or <hi>Needle-Cape,</hi> are Sharks-bones found, which the Goldſmiths uſe; although ſome are of opinion they came from the Sea-Cat or <hi>Bleach,</hi> with which that Sea abounds.</p>
                     <p>In the particular relations of this Countrey,
<note place="margin">Cattel.</note> we told you they had great ſtore of Cattel; We will now onely add, That the Oxen are very fair, fleſhy, and thick, and ſome near half a foot higher than thoſe among us; with very fine, ſlender, and long crook'd Horns: Others have their Horns flat and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down looſe by their bodies.</p>
                     <p>They have infinite flocks of Sheep, very large, with long Legs, and Hair in ſtead of Wool; their tails are nothing but fat, and ſome of them ſo heavy, that they have weigh'd eighteen or twenty pounds and more.</p>
                     <p>The Woods, Valleys, and plain low Gronds, feed many wild Beaſts; as Stags or Harts, Roe-Hindes, and wild Cows, who run together by ſixty, ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yea a hundred in a Head. Badgers, of a red colour, but ſo ſlow in running, that a man may eaſily outſtrip them, yet their fleſh is accounted a pleaſant food. Wild-Bears, Wild-Goats, Hares, Conies, Ringſtreak'd Tygers, a fierce and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Beaſt, Leopards, Wolves, <hi>Rhinocerots,</hi> and Elephants.</p>
                     <p>On the tops of the Mountains, keep multitudes of fierce Lions, which in dark Moons come out of their hideous Dens of ſhelter, and ſeek their prey cloſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fort; and therefore they always about the Incloſure (where the Cattel are kept in by night) kindle great fires to ſcare them away.</p>
                     <p>There are found great Beaſts like Elephants, with two Horns at their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſuch as the <hi>Rhinocerots</hi> hath one. It ordinarily goes ſwifter than a man, in its ſpeedieſt courſe, hath a skin with ſhort Mouſe-dun hair, a tail and feet like an Elephant, ſtreight and round ears, and a ſhort bunch of black hair, in ſtead of a Mane on the Neck.</p>
                     <p>Here have been ſeen many Jack-alls, being a creature that by his quick ſcent diſcovers prey for the Lion, and is both his Guard and Spie.</p>
                     <p>The Ocean alſo produces many Creatures, as Sea-Rabbits, Sea-Dogs, Sea-Wolves, or Sea-Bears, who in the Summer ſwim in the Sea, but in the Winter remain under ground, and keep on Shore, and in the Cliffs.</p>
                     <p>The Sea-Wolves, or rather Sea-Bears, becauſe with their paws and geſtures more reſemble Bears than Wolves, onely they have ſharper Snouts, and are a fiercer Creature, biting cruelly; they exceed men for the moſt part in ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of running, ſo without two or three they are not to be taken.</p>
                     <p>On the Shore of the Rivers, are many Sea-Horſes, Porcupiſſes, or Sea-Hogs, and Sea-Cats.</p>
                     <p>Many ſorts of ſmall and great Fowls are found here;
<note place="margin">Fowls.</note> as Partridges, Ducks, Sparrows, Geeſe, Wild-Ducks, Parrets will yellow Bills, More-hens, Wagtails, Gulls, Teal, Wood-Snipes and Water-Snipes, and Cormorants, being a black ſort of Fowl, as big and as large as Ducks or Geeſe.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Pinguyns.</note> with ſmall thick Feathers, more like Briſtles or Beaſts Hair than Plumes; in ſtead of Wings they have a Leather Finn on each Foot, wherewith they ſwim; they have very tough Skins, are cruel in
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:56692:368"/>biting, ready in diving, and keep as well in the Sea as at Land. They harbor in the Sedges, lie in a Burrow ſcraped out hollow, and lay their Eggs in the Sand, to the number of four or five, bigger than Gooſe-Eggs, and with a white Shell. They have ſo ſlow a pace that we eaſily catch them, or follow them to their Neſts, which they defend with biting, and are not to be forced thence without Staves. Their Fleſh is Oylie, and not good to eat, except they be two or three times boyl'd in freſh Water, and then fry'd in a Pan with Butter or Suet.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo Moor-Cocks, Marſh-Fowl, with red Bills and Legs, wild Peacocks, white Shovelers, as big as a Hen, with a Neck in two or three Joynts, Herons of three ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> blue ones, white ones, of a middle ſize, and black, as big as Sea-pies, which keep moſt in Mooriſh places; Cranes, ſeveral kinds of Hawks, Peacocks, Pheaſants, Partridges, Ravens, Crows and Oſtriches.</p>

                     <p>The Fowls which come from Land and frequent the Sea, are of divers ſorts, as the <hi>Antenagas,</hi> great ſpeckled Fowls, which many times ſit upon the dry places within the Water about the <hi>Needle-Cape.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcatraces,</hi> a gray Fowl, almoſt like a Lapwing.</p>
                     <p>Pheaſants, little bigger than Swallows, white-feather'd, with gray or black Specks, ringſtreaked, and ſpeckled in their Bodies, and therefore eaſie to be known from the other.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gavoitoyns,</hi> or <hi>Dyvers,</hi> which ſit in the Water about the <hi>Cape.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Jan-van-Genten,</hi> or white Plovers, tipt with black at the end of their Wings.</p>
                     <p>Another ſort of great Fowls, call'd in <hi>Portugueſe, Mangas de Velludo,</hi> or <hi>Velvet-Parrots,</hi> have black Tufts like Velvet on their Wings, and in flying hold them not ſteady, but flutter as Pigeons.</p>
                     <p>As the Air is thus repleniſhed with good Fowl, no leſs doth the Sea,
<note place="margin">Fiſhes.</note> and other Waters abound with the variety of Fiſh, particularly one ſort call'd <hi>Huygen,</hi> in ſhape like Carps, being of a very pleaſant taſte.</p>

                     <p>Such a Mantle conſiſts of three Pieces, neatly ſew'd together with Sinews of Beaſts in ſtead of Threed. When they go abroad, or upon a Journey, they throw another Sheeps-skin, with the Wool on the out-ſide, over the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. Upon their Heads they wear a Cap of Lamb-skin, with the Woolly ſide inward, and a Button on the top.</p>
                     <p>Their Shoes are made of a <hi>Rhinocerot's</hi> Skin, and conſiſts of a whole flat Piece, before and behind of a like heighth, with a Croſs of two Leather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands faſten'd to their Feet.

<note place="margin">The Habit of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> being a Sheep-skin Mantle on the upper part of their Bodies, with the Wool inwards; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer than the Men; alſo another Skin hanging behind to cover their back-parts, and a ſquare Piece before their Privacies.</p>
                     <p>On their Heads they wear a high Cap of a Sheeps, or Badgers Skin, bound to their Heads with a broad Fillet: In all the reſt following the Mens Garb.</p>
                     <p>No leſs uncomely are their choyceſt Ornaments, for the Men have their Hair dreſſed up, or adorn'd with Copper-plates, white little Horns, and great Beads. They pull all the Hair out of their Chins, and daub their Faces with Black, and then anoint them with Greaſe and Tallow, and thereby ſeem as if they never were waſhed.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which dwell cloſe by the <hi>Cape</hi> on the Shore, and come to the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> Ships, preſently run to the Cook's Kettle, or Pottage-pot, and anoint themſelves with the Soot thereof, which they eſteem a Princely Ornament.</p>
                     <p>Such as are rich, and have good ſtocks of Cattel, liquor the out-ſide of their Mantles and Caps with Greaſe; whereas the Poor wear them ſtarved and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquor'd. Alſo moſt of the Princes and Kings, and Kings Daughters, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the King of <hi>Cocoquas,</hi> his Vice-Roy, and Daughter <hi>Mamis,</hi> wear fat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear'd Skins. In their Ears they hang great bunches of Beads, of which ſome contain ten or eleven Strings, each weighing near a quarter of a Pound. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Necks they put red and yellow Copper Chains, or Bracelets of Beads, and upon their Arms Ivory Armlets, and forwards near the Wriſts, Bracelets of Copper, which ſtick ſo cloſe, that it makes their Arms ſore, and ſometimes come to ulcerate before they will lay them off.</p>
                     <p>Many of them wear as an Ornament, the Guts of Beaſts, freſh and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drawn two or three times one through another, about their Necks, and the like about their Legs.</p>
                     <p>Some wear a ſort of Roots gather'd from the bottoms of Rivers, which in their Journeys through Woods, where Lyons, Leopards, and Wolves fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, by the Fire ſide (which they kindle at the Place where they ſtay all night, for the driving away wild Beaſts) they chew into little bits, and ſpit out of their Mouthes round about, with firm perſwaſion, that there is ſuch vertue in them, as no Beaſt can endure the ſmell of it.</p>
                     <p>When they go abroad they have uſually an Oſtrich Feather, or a Staff, with a wild Cats Tail ty'd to it, in one Hand, in ſtead of a Handkerchief to wipe their Eyes and Noſes, and beat away the Duſt, Sand, and Flies, and in the other Hand a ſleight Javelin.</p>
                     <p>The Women never go abroad without a Leather Sack at their backs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at each end a Tuft or Taſſel, and fill'd with one trifle or another.</p>
                     <p>Their Weapons, or Arms, are Bowes and Arrows, and ſmall Darts, three, four, or five Foot long, having at one end a broad ſharp Iron fixed, which they handle and throw very dexterouſly.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>They take great delight in our Bread, for which they are willing to barter Cattel. The Honey found in the Woods they eat up Wax an all; and in ſtead of Phyſick adminiſter to the Sick, Cabbages, Coleworts, and Muſtard-Leaves, with a little beaten Lard boyl'd with it.</p>
                     <p>Their common Drink is Water,
<note place="margin">Drink.</note> or <hi>Mille;</hi> but they are very greedy of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, as alſo of Tobacco, but quickly become Drunk with it.</p>
                     <p>They uſe no Trades, Handicrafts, or Arts; with Bulruſhes make Mats, wherewith they cover their Houſes; they Forge the ſharp Heads of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being Iron; in the doing whereof they uſe onely a Stone and Hammer, making it malleable with Wood-Coals.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Goringhaica's</hi> dwelling by the <hi>Cape,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Employment.</note> employ themſelves in Fiſhing, which they ſell to the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> for Bread and Tobacco. Moſt of the other have no skill therein, nor any Veſſels to go out to Sea, ſo that in all Journeys they go by Land, and on Foot. In ſtead of Horſes they have great Oxen, who carry their Goods and Commodities from one place to another, which they lead and guide with a Stick thruſt through their Noſes, as with a Bridle.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cochoqua's,</hi> or <hi>Saldanhars,</hi> are a kind of Herdſmen, and live by keeping of Cattel, whereof they have above an hundred thouſand Head, all very fair, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides as many Sheep. The like do the <hi>Cariguriqua's</hi> and <hi>Hoſaa's:</hi> None amongſt them all Sowe, or Plant, but onely the <hi>Heuſaqua's.</hi> When they perceive any
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:56692:372"/>wild Beaſts in the Night, whether Elephants, Elans, Rhinocerots, Lyons, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Bucks, or Horſes, then all the ſtouteſt Men run forth, and make a great noiſe to fright them away. But if by day any devouring wild Beaſt appear, then all that can carry Arms go forth, every one provided with two or three <hi>Aſſagays,</hi> or Lances, and encompaſſing the ſame with extraordinary outcries and ſhoutings, they let fly their Darts, and Shoot, as at a Mark to wound and kill him.</p>
                     <p>When a perſon falls in Love with a Maid, he deſires of his Father,
<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> that he may Marry her, who conſenting, he goes to the Father and Mother of the Maid, entreating the ſame: and when the Parents grant his Suit, the Daughter receives, and as a ſign of her acceptance, and in confirmation of the Marriage, ſhe puts about his Neck, not a Gold Chain, but a fat Cows Chitterling, which he muſt wear till it drop off. Then two of the fatteſt Sheep are ſought out of the whole Flock, and kill'd, part of whoſe Fleſh being boyl'd, and part of it roaſted, none may eat but the Marry'd couple and their Parents; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Ceremony the Marriage would not be accounted lawful. The Skins cut in ſmall pieces, and the Hair taken off, then beaten upon a Stone, and ſo laid on hot Coals, they eat with a very great appetite. This pitiful Feaſt end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſolemnity of the Wedding is over.</p>
                     <p>As to their conſtancy in Love, they are as in other places, ſome quickly nauſeating the ties of Marriage, while others obſerve it with a moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtrictneſs. For the manifeſting of the conſtancy and true Love amongſt ſome of theſe Salvages, we will give you two remarkable Stories, the one of a Widow, which through exceſs of grief and ſorrow for the death of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, leapt into a Pit full of Wood, ſet it on fire, and burnt her ſelf to death: the other of a young Maid, which for grief threw her ſelf down from a Rock, becauſe her Parents had caus'd her Lover to be ſeverely whipt with Thorns, for Lying with her againſt their conſents.</p>
                     <p>Whether by the goodneſs of the Air, or the natural ſtrength of their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, theſe People attain ſo great an age, as generally they do, remains a doubt; but this is certain, that moſt of them live to eighty, ninety, or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and ſome to a hundred and ten, twenty, or more years.</p>
                     <p>They bury their Dead ſitting in a deep Pit ſtark naked,
<note place="margin">Funerals.</note> throwing the Earth upon their Heads with a great heap of Stones over all, to preſerve the Corps from being raked out of the Grave by wild Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>When a Man or Woman dies,
<note place="margin">Inheritance.</note> all the Friends to the third degree of Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, muſt by an antient cuſtom cut off the little Finger of their left Hand, to be bury'd with the Dead in the Grave; but if the Deceaſed had in his Life any Cattel, and leaves ſome Relations to whom they might come by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they muſt cut off a Joynt from each little Finger before they can take the Cattel: for the Sick cannot giveaway the leaſt thing on his Death-bed, from thoſe to whom it falls by Inheritance.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as any one falls ſick, thoſe about him fetch one skill'd in Herbs, who with a ſharp two-edged Knife lets them blood on their Back, then burns them on their Arms, with a red hot Iron, and drops thereon ſome Juyce of Herbs, with new boyl'd ſweet Milk: And if this work not a Cure, they give them over for Dead.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which rob in the Day, if they be catcht in it, are beaten by the King, or <hi>Choeque</hi> himſelf with a Stick, without other puniſhment; but thoſe which Rob in the Night, receive upon diſcovery a more ſevere puniſhment
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:56692:373"/>in this manner inflicted. The Offender is firſt for a whole day tied Hand and Foot, being neither allowed Meat or Drink: On the ſecond day ſome of the Eldeſt go to the <hi>Coehque,</hi> to ask if they ſhall proceed in the Execution, which is done without any Condemnation or Tryal, but not without ſufficient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony; whereupon the King, with a great Train of People following him, comes to a Tree, where he commands the Offender to be brought before him, whom they bind to the Tree, and very ſeverely whip all over his Body, that the Blood runs down to his Feet. After this, being turned with his Face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King, a ſort of Gum, or Rozin, melted in a Pot, is poured over his naked Body, from his Neck running down upon his Breaſt, ſo that the Skin immediately peels off; then they let him looſe, and give him ſome Meat, wherewith a little refreſh'd, they tie him again Neck and Heels, and ſo leave him three days: And laſtly, after the enduring all this pain, he is ſometimes baniſh'd, and thruſt from their Society.</p>
                     <p>When any are found in Fornication,
<note place="margin">Inceſt.</note> the Parents force them to Marry imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, if they have a competency of Eſtate: But if that cannot be effected, then they wait to know if the Woman be with Child; and then they enforce a Conjunction, though the Perſon be ſo mean that he cannot maintain a Wife.</p>
                     <p>When any Perſon, Rich or Poor, is diſcover'd to have committed Inceſt, they believe ſuch People cannot be puniſhed enough, becauſe they ſay it is an unpardonable offence; and this from the meer Light of Nature: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they puniſh the Tranſgreſſors with death; the manner this.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all the Man hath his Hands and his Feet drawn together with a Cord,
<note place="margin">How they are puniſh'd.</note> and ſo put into a Tub till the next day, and the Woman ſet by it. The ſecond day they take him out, and ſo Manacled ſet him under a Tree, faſtning his Head to a ſtrong Bough, which one pulls and holds down; then they cut off one Member after another: Afterwards they let the Bough ſpring up again, with the mangled Body upon it, for a Spectacle to other Evil-doers.</p>
                     <p>The Man thus dead, they bring forth the Woman, whom bound round about with many dry Shrub-Bavins, her Hands and Feet tied faſt together, they ſet Fire to the Buſhes, and ſo burn her to Aſhes.</p>
                     <p>A little above five years ago it hapned that a certain Perſon, a great Friend and Acquaintance of the <hi>Coehques,</hi> or King of the <hi>Saldanhars,</hi> committed Inceſt; yet for all that, without reſpect to his Perſon, he did Juſtice upon him.</p>
                     <p>If any Man of Wealth and Quality,
<note place="margin">Puniſhment for killing and wounding.</note> or reputed Wiſe, through fury or rage ſtab or wound another to death, they take him and beat his Brains out againſt a Tree, and put him into the Grave with the murdered Perſon; for they ſay, Such a Perſon being endued with more Underſtanding, ought to know better, and to give a good Example to others: Whereas on the other ſide, poor ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple People are permitted to ranſom their Lives by a Payment of Cattel. Some, for Offences which deſerve Death, have their Knees nail'd through, and an Iron Pin faſt driven into each Shoulder, ſo dying a lingring death.</p>
                     <p>They live like the <hi>Arabians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their Houſes.</note> in the Fields, in Huts made of ſlender crooked Poles, ſet round and cover'd with Bulruſh-Mats: Some of theſe are ſo large, that conveniently ten or twenty Men, with Women and Children, may dwell in one of them; though others are much leſs, and ſome ſo ſmall, that they can take them up, and run away with them. The Fire-place lieth in the midſt of the Houſe; but they make no Funnels to carry up the Smoke.</p>
                     <p>They kindle Fire with an excellent dexterity, by rubbing one little hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Stick upon another very hard for a great ſpace.</p>
                     <pb n="595" facs="tcp:56692:373"/>
                     <p>All theſe <hi>Hottentots</hi> ſpeak one and the ſame Language,
<note place="margin">Language.</note> which for the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the pronunciation cannot be learn'd, to the great retarding and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of further Diſcoveries. In all Diſcourſe they cluck like a Broody Hen, ſeeming to cackle at every other Word: So that their Mouths are almoſt like a Rattle or Clapper, ſmacking, and making a great noiſe with their Tongues.</p>
                     <p>Some words they know not how to utter, but with very much ado, and they ſeem as if they fetch'd it out behind, at the bottom of their Throats, and as the People in <hi>Savoy</hi> that live near the <hi>Alps,</hi> who by drinking Snow-water have great Crops or Swellings under their Chins. <hi>Brokwa</hi> in their Language ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Bread, Kahou</hi> denotes to <hi>ſit down, Bou</hi> is <hi>an Ox, Ba, a Sheep,</hi> and <hi>Kori, Iron:</hi> But now many of them which dwell cloſe to the Fort of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> by daily Converſe with the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> ſpeak <hi>Dutch;</hi> as ſome who have been with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Bantam,</hi> ſtammer ſome broken <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have no inclination to Trading,
<note place="margin">Trade.</note> neither hold they any Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with Foreign People. iron and Copper were the onely Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deſired by them; the former for Arms, the other for Ornament; both which they ſo eſteemed, that in a Voyage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> in the year Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety five, the <hi>Dutch</hi> had in Barter with theſe People, for a Cutting-knife, a fair Ox; for a Bar of Iron of ſeventy pounds, broken into five pieces, two Oxen and three Sheep; for one Hook-knife, one Bill, one Ax, one ſhort Iron Bolt, and ſome pieces of Iron, three Oxen and five Sheep; and for a Knife, one Sheep. But at this day, grown wiſer by Converſe, and the abundance of Commodities carried thither, they prize their Cattel at a much higher rate, and their former fair dealing is not now found amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Tobacco, Brandy, and Copper, they chiefly deſire at preſent; but the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower the better: So that for four pieces of Copper, as big as the Palm of ones Hand, and a piece of Tobacco, they uſually buy two Cows.</p>
                     <p>Some of theſe People have Elective, others Succeſſive Kings or Governors;
<note place="margin">Government.</note> but all their Powers not able to make above four or five thouſand Men, and thoſe living diſperſedly in ſeveral Plantations, far diſtant from each other.</p>
                     <p>Religion is an abſolute ſtranger among all theſe Salvages,
<note place="margin">Religion.</note> inſomuch that they never worſhipped either God or Devil; yet they ſay and believe there is a Divine Power, which they call <hi>Humma,</hi> which cauſeth Rain, Winds, Heat, and Cold; but will not worſhip him, becauſe he ſends ſometimes too much Heat and Drowth, and another time an overflux of Rain, contrary to their deſires.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They imagine, that they can ſtop the Rain, and allay the Wind at their pleaſure. Firſt, To cauſe Rain to ceaſe, they lay a ſmall Cole of Fire on a Chip, in a little Hole digged in the Ground; and upon that Hole they lay a Lock of Hair pull'd from their Heads, and cover up the Hole with Sand; when the Hair begins to ſtink, then they make Water upon it, and ſo run away ſhrieking. To lay the Winds, they hold one of the greaſieſt Skins upon a long Stick aloft in the Air, till the Wind has blown down the Skin; and then vainly think the power of the Wind ſmothered thereby.</p>
                     <p>When the New Moon begins firſt to be diſcerned, they commonly in great Companies turn themſelves towards it, and ſpend the whole night in great joy, with Dancing, Singing, and Clapping of Hands.</p>
                     <p>They have a Muſical Inſtrument, made with a String like a Bowe, and a ſplit Quill at the end, which being blowed yields a low ſound.</p>

                  <p>The Emperor keeps a great Train of Servants, who all attend in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, bowing of the Knee when they ſpeak to him. His Meat is ſerv'd up to his Table in Pourcelane, round beſet with Gold Branches.</p>

<note place="margin">Plants.</note> and in ſome places abundance of Sugar-Canes, that grow without Planting, to the increaſe whereof, the Rivers and Brooks that beſprinkle the Countrey do not a little help.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt Wealth of the Countrey conſiſts in Oxen and Cowes,
<note place="margin">Beaſts.</note> with them more highly eſteem'd than Gold or Silver.

They ſhew a Beaſt call'd <hi>Alſinge,</hi> reſembling a Stag or Hart; and Oſtriches as big as Oxen. There grows upon Trees call'd <hi>Koskoma</hi> a Fruit of a Violet Colour, and ſweet in taſte; of which whoever eats plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, it purges them ſo violently, that a Bloody-Flux, and at length Death follows upon it.</p>
                  <p>Here are found ſeveral Gold Mines in the Bowels of the Earth,
<note place="margin">Gold Mines.</note> and alſo in ſome of their Rivers, for which the Inhabitants dive in the Stream, and take it up with the bottom from the Mud, and ſo pick it out; which Gold-diving they alſo practice in divers great Lakes, ſpread far and near in this Kingdom;

                  </p>
                  <p>All the Inhabitants have ſhort and black curl'd Hair,
<note place="margin">The Conſtitution of the Inhabitants.</note> and, as <hi>Linſchot</hi> ſaith, are of a middle Stature; though <hi>Pigafet</hi> makes them a kind of Giants. They are well ſet, of a ſound Body, of Complexion black, very apprehenſive and quick of Underſtanding, much addicted to War, and apt to make Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections upon any trivial cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Their uſual Food is ſalt Beef, Milk, and a little Verjuyce, and Oyl of <hi>Seſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos;</hi> Their Bread made of Rice, <hi>Mille,</hi> or of the Root <hi>Ignamees,</hi> which they boyl in Baſons; The Drink of the Common People, Milk; but of the King, and the Grandees, Wine of Honey, or Meath, which they preſerve in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns; or Wine of Palm, made delicious with Manna, Amber, and Musk.</p>
                  <p>The King beſtows every day in Perfumes two pound of Gold, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Merchants furniſh him with: For the Torches and Lights which he uſes are mix'd with ſweet Odours, which he cauſes to be born before him in the night, being ſet in a richly Embroider'd Pavilion, carry'd by four Noble-men, follow'd by a great Train, and cover'd over with a Canopy, in manner of an <hi>Umbrella,</hi> ſet with Precious Stones.</p>
                  <p>The King never gives Audience to any Man when he Travels, or is ready to take a Journey; neither goes he out of his Palace, but upon ſome well-order'd Beaſt, an Elephant, or the before-mention'd <hi>Alſinge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King may not Clothe himſelf but according to the manner of his Anceſtors,
<note place="margin">The Kings Clothing.</note> in a long Cloak, made in that Countrey; for he weareth no Foreign Garment, for fear of Poyſon; and upon that, a long and great Cloth, in form of a Coat or Womans Gown, which comes to his Knees, and from thence to his Middle button'd up, with a coſtly Knot upon his Shoulder. He wears uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at his Girdle a Spade with an Ivory Handle, and in his Hand two Arrows; intending by the Spade to give his Subjects to underſtand, That in time of Peace they ought to be diligent in Tilling the Land; by one of the Arrows, That he hath power to puniſh Evil-doers; and by the other, that he muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants go naked from their Necks to their Girdle;
<note place="margin">Apparel.</note> but from thence down to their Feet they have Garments of Cloth of divers Colours, and of Wild Beaſts Skins, and their Privacies hidden in ſmall Purſes.

                  <p>The Women go naked as long as they are unmarried, only wearing a ſmall Cotton Cloth before; but as ſoon as they are married, and have Children, they cover their Breaſts and Bodies with Cotton Clothes.</p>
                  <p>Every one may have as many Women as he can maintain; but the firſt is accounted the Head of the Family, and all the reſt are at her ſervice; and her Children, after the Fathers death, inherit all the Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>The Women are here in ſo much eſteem, that the Kings Sons, if they meet a Woman on the way, muſt ſtep aſide.</p>
                  <p>The Houſes are built of Wood like Tents, and cover'd with Straw for a Defence from the Rain; but the Richer, and Perſons of Quality, have them ſomewhat more handſom and convenient.</p>

                  <p>The People are charged neither with Taxes or other Payments to the King;
<note place="margin">Revenue of the King.</note> but when they deſire to have Audience from him, they carry a Preſent with them, by reaſon it is contrary to the Cuſtom of the Place, that an Inferior ſhould ſpeak to a Superior without bringing a Preſent, for a ſign of Obedience and Honor: And all the Perſons of Quality are bound to ſerve the King ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days in thirty.</p>
                  <p>The Merchants that Trade there muſt alſo give ſome Preſents to the King, for the neglect whereof they incur his Diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The Wealth of this Countrey conſiſts in Gold found in Mines and Rivers;
<note place="margin">Riches. <hi>Ja rik</hi> lib ca 42. <hi>Sanut.</hi> lib. 1.</note> which though little valu'd, yet they narrowly ſearch for, becauſe they find it neceſſary for the Purchaſe of Outlandiſh Merchandizes.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperor keeps continually a ſtrong Army, conſiſting all of Foot, for they have no Horſe; beſides a ſtout Party of Valiant <hi>Amazonian</hi> Women, which March and Fight as well as the Men, burning off their left Breaſts, that they may ſhoot with the more readineſs and eaſe. They carry the ſame Arms with the Men, and ſhoot backwards or behind them when they fly; but when they obſerve the following Enemy to Retreat and draw off, they ſuddenly face about, and fall upon them, committing great Slaughter.</p>
                  <p>None waſhes their Hands or Face during the Wars: Every one carries his own ordinary Proviſions; but the King provides Sheep and Oxen. They cut off the Members of thoſe they take in Battel, and drying the ſame, preſent it to their Wives, to wear for an Ornament about their Necks; and ſhe that wears moſt of them, hath moſt reſpect, becauſe it teſtifies her Husbands Valour.</p>
                  <p>Before the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> became Maſters of this Coaſt,

                  <p>The Emperor hath ſeveral Great Lords his Vaſſals; and for the better hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in Obedience, according to an ancient Cuſtom, keeps their next Succeſſors, upon pretence to be honorably brought up, in his Court; though in truth to be as Hoſtages for their Fidelity. He ſends alſo Agents every year to his Subſtitute Kings and Lords, to give them new Fire, with command to put out all the other. When the Agent comes to the Court of one of theſe Lords, every one muſt put out his Fire, and not kindle it again before the Agent has made a new one, from whence all the Subjects of this Lord muſt fetch and carry it into their Houſes. He that ſeems unwilling in this Work, is taken and puniſh'd for a Mutineer.</p>
                  <p>The King keeps commonly a thouſand Women, or more, being all Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his inferior Lords; but the firſt married commands the reſt, let her be never ſo mean.</p>
                  <p>The Chief Sovereign is call'd <hi>Benomotapa,</hi> that is, <hi>Emperor,</hi> or <hi>Munnemotapa,</hi>

                  <p>The King receives and expects extraordinary Honors from his Subjects, by whom ſerv'd on the Knee, as we have ſaid; onely the <hi>Portugueſe, Moors,</hi> and

                  <p>The King and all his Juſtices, are very ſtrict in the proſecution of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Duty, to puniſh Offenders with great ſeverity.</p>
                  <p>The Sentences of theſe Judges are eſtabliſh'd by the Emperor, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender immediately puniſh'd: As ſoon as any one hath committed an offence, he is puniſh'd in the Field, while the Fact is freſh in memory; but if it require to keep the Offender ſome days, they tie him under a Tree, and ſet upon him a Watch, by reaſon they have no Priſons, ſo that the Offender ſeeing no way to eſcape, poyſons himſelf; ſo by a ſudden death, to be freed from the cruelty of a lingering puniſhment. When any injures another without a cauſe, they lay him naked upon the earth, and cruelly beat him with a Rope full of knots; which puniſhment the Judges themſelves are ſubject to, and the greateſt Lords and Magiſtrates, beſides the Confiſcation of their Eſtates and Offices.</p>
                  <p>If the Judges have any difficult buſineſs, whereof they can find no proof, they give the ſuſpected perſon the Bark of a Tree cut ſmall, in Water, and if he can keep that potion without Vomiting, they clear him, otherwiſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him to death.</p>
                  <p>Theſe People are for the moſt part Pagans, they call their chiefeſt God, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziry,</hi> that is, <hi>The Creator of all things.</hi> They ſhew great reverence to a certain Maid call'd <hi>Peru,</hi> in whoſe honor they ſhut up their Daughters in Cloyſters as Recluſes.</p>
                  <p>Moreover,

But the earneſt endeavour of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, hath converted many to Chriſtianity, and brought them to receive Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>In the Year Fifteen hundred and ſixty, the King himſelf, with his Mother, and above three hundred Nobles, and chiefeſt Lords of the Realm, were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd by the hands of the Jeſuit, call'd <hi>Gonzales Sylveyra;</hi> but afterwards, at the inſtigation of ſome <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> he was ſlain by the King's command, with the imputation of a Sorcerer; but a little time diſcovering their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, they made ſatisfaction for his undeſerv'd death, with the loſs of their own Heads.</p>

<pb n="606" facs="tcp:56692:379"/>again after three years Voyage, loaden with Gold, and Elephants-Teeth. We conceive it not unfit in brief to relate the difference of the ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt about this place, hitherto clearly decided, with the Arguments on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arias Montanus, Baftellus, Goropius,</hi> and others, are of opinion, that <hi>Ophir</hi> was that part of <hi>America,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Peru;</hi> and divided North, and South <hi>Peru:</hi> therefore they conclude from the word <hi>Parvaim,</hi> in the Hebrew Text, being the Plural Number, and that this Gold was brought from the two <hi>Peru's;</hi> but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oppoſite Arguments refel this Opinion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is probable, that <hi>Peru</hi> in the time of <hi>Solomon</hi> was not known; nor which is more, the Voyage to <hi>Peru,</hi> over ſo wide a ſpace of Seas, not poſſible to be perform'd, eſpecially for want of the uſe of the Load-ſtone and Compaſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are in <hi>Peru</hi> no Elephants; ſo that by conſequence, from thence no Ivory, or Elephants Teeth could be brought.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If <hi>Solomon</hi> were to go with a Fleet to <hi>Peru</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> it might have been ſent more conveniently out of ſome Haven of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>-Sea, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer than out of <hi>Ezien-geber,</hi> at the Red-Sea, to fetch ſo long a compaſs, by the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> and the whole <hi>Guinee-Coaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> an ingenious Expounder of the Hebrew, who in the year Four hundred twenty two, in the Nineteenth year of his Age, departed this world under <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperor, by the word <hi>Ophir,</hi> underſtands good or pure Gold; and in his Tranſlation ſets down very good Gold, and not Gold of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruaen,</hi> or of any Countrey: but this opinion alſo is long ago rejected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Athanaſius Kircher,</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Coptick</hi> or <hi>Egyptian</hi> Language, aſſerts, that <hi>Ophir</hi> is a <hi>Coptick,</hi> or <hi>Egyptian</hi> word; whereby the ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the <hi>Indies,</hi> containing the Kingdoms of <hi>Malabar, Scilon,</hi> and the <hi>Golden-Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneſus,</hi> or the deſcending Countrey of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> about the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a Bay, by him call'd, <hi>The Great;</hi> as alſo <hi>Sumattra,</hi> the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands, Great, and Little <hi>Java;</hi> and other adjacent Iſlands full of Gold, whither King <hi>Solomon's</hi> Fleet went with King <hi>Hiram:</hi> The Gold of <hi>Parvaim, Kircherus</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth was the Gold of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In ſetting <hi>Ophir</hi> in <hi>Eaſt-Indie,</hi> (as <hi>Kircher</hi> doth) and not in <hi>America,</hi> the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Geographers agree; as <hi>Ortelius, Volaterranus, Gramas,</hi> and others; yet divers make <hi>Ophir</hi> the ſame with <hi>Sofala,</hi> becauſe it has much Gold, and Ivory. And if all the main Land (included between the Rivers <hi>Magnice,</hi> and <hi>Quama,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting unto <hi>Monomotapa</hi>) be all as <hi>Barros, Calles,</hi> or <hi>Sofala,</hi> as well as the reſt on the Sea-Coaſt, it may with great reaſon be judg'd, that this Countrey can be no other than the Golden <hi>Ophir</hi> of <hi>Solomon;</hi> partly becauſe of the Houſes there to be found, near the Gold-Mines; not built after the manner of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but ſeem the work of Foreigners; and partly, becauſe of the Inſcriptions in ſtrange and unknown Letters. Moreover, <hi>Thomas Lopez</hi> in his Voyage to the <hi>Indies</hi> affirms, that among the Inhabitants of this Countrey, there remain Books which ſhew, that <hi>Solomon</hi> every three year had his Gold thence.

                     <p>The Iſlands were formerly inhabited by the <hi>Arabians;</hi> as may plainly appear by the Ruines of the Houſes, and <hi>Moſques,</hi> being built by people leſs barbarous, than thoſe that have their Reſidence there at this day, of Lime, Stone, and Tiles, like the Cities of <hi>Quiloa, Monbaza,</hi> and <hi>Melinde.</hi> But ſince the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> began to ſet forth their Ships to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the Souldiers and Mariners, out of a natural hatred and antipathy to all <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> thought it not enough to rob them, burn their Houſes, and <hi>Moſques,</hi> and to carry them away for Slaves, but with a ſweeping Rage, ſparing neither Age nor Sex, deſtroy'd all of the remainder.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Iſlands many years ſince, lay waſte and void of people, till ſome <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> from the Main-Land wafted themſelves over thither, and planted them, and ſo became ſubject to the Governor of <hi>Mayambique,</hi> about three and thirty miles from thence; from whence every year cometh a Judge to decide Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.</p>
                     <p>The Lord of every Iſland hath his Houſe built of Stone, and Lime, wherein reſides his Wife, Children, and Slaves of both Sexes, as alſo Friends, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom they hire, to have their aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Negro's</hi> of the Main-Land, which by their living ſo near, are ready enough to do them a miſchief; And therefore, both themſelves and Slaves are Arm'd with Muskets, Piſtols, and other Weapons.</p>

                  <p>This Kingdom, before the coming of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> thither, ſpread it ſelf along the Sea-Coaſt above a hundred and fifty <hi>Dutch</hi> miles: for he Reigned formerly over <hi>Sofalo, Quamma, Angos,</hi> and <hi>Mozambike;</hi> but when <hi>Francois Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda,</hi> in the Year One thouſand five hundred and five, put in for this Coaſt with the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Fleet, the King; though invited to Friendſhip, prepared for a Warlike Defence; whereupon ſeven hundred <hi>Portugueſe</hi> went on Shore, who quickly took the City, and put him to flight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sanutus</hi> ſaith this Countrey hath ſuch an antipathy to the nature of the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans,</hi> that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> found themſelves neceſſitated to forſake the ſame, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they had built a Fort there, and made no doubt but to have been the Maſters thereof.

                     <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> had formerly thrown up a Fortification at the Shore of this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo that none could come into the City but through it, being environ'd with a Wall, planted with Guns to defend it againſt the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who in the Year Fifteen hundred, under the Command of <hi>Vaſques de Gamma</hi> took this Fort, with all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time the City was alſo conquer'd by a People call'd <hi>Imbires,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not far from the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> by the aid of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> after a long Siege, into which five hundred of them entring by Storm, pull'd down the Walls, Churches, and a greatvaulted Caſtle, to the ground, and burn'd all the Ships in the Haven. The King of <hi>Mombaza</hi> himſelf, with all his Courtiers and great Officers, fell into the hands of theſe <hi>Imbires,</hi> which not onely put them to death, but eat them up.</p>
                     <p>The City was once before, in the Year Fifteen hundred and five, ruin'd by one <hi>Francois Almede;</hi> and ſome years afterwards again re-built by the King of <hi>Mombaza:</hi> but it long held not up its head, being again aſſaulted, taken, and plunder'd by another <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> call'd <hi>Nunno de Acunha,</hi> who endeavouring to ſettle, were forced to leave their Conqueſt and retire to the fore-mention'd Fort, but were alſo at laſt diſpoſſeſſed thereof by the ſame King, in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty one.</p>
                     <p>The temperature of the Air gives no cauſe of complaint to ſuch as dwell there,

                     <p>The Women are very richly Habited,

<pb n="615" facs="tcp:56692:383"/>the Earth as the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> do upon the Sea. He is ſaid to be ſo arrogant and ſelf-conceited, that at the falling of Rain againſt his pleaſure, or exceſſive Heat, he breaks out into ſeveral exclamations againſt Heaven, and out of madneſs draws his Bowe againſt the Sun. In brief, he calls himſelf the Emperor of all the World, and imagines that he ſhall overcome the whole Earth. He keeps commonly an Army of fourſcore thouſand Men in the Field, and in their March obſerves this Order: Firſt he commands to go before him many Droves of Cattel; next ſeveral perſons carry Fire, whereby he intends to declare, that all thoſe whom he Conquers, muſt expect nothing elſe but to be Roaſted and Eaten: All the Towns and Villages he travels through of the Enemies, he ruines, and without diſtinguiſhing of Men from Beaſts, kills all he finds, ſo that all ſtand in great fear of him, and betake themſelves to flight when they hear of his approach.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Here is but onely one City, nam'd <hi>Sicuthora,</hi> ſeated at the foot of the <hi>Cape Treta,</hi> looking to the South, where the <hi>Xeque,</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Governor makes his aboad.

Every Church hath three Doors, and one Altar, on which ſtands a Croſs, with two Sticks, made in form of Flower-de-luces.</p>
                     <p>The Situation of the Iſland ſo near the Line cauſes the Air not onely to be exceeding hot,
<note place="margin">Air.</note> but alſo unhealthy. And by reaſon of this exceſſive Heat, they have great want of Water: Yet notwithſtanding there falls a great Miſt in the Nights from the high ſtony Cliffs, to the great cooling and refreſhing of the parched Earth: And although a few Rivers may be found, yet they lie at ſuch
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:56692:387"/>diſtances from the common Paſſages, and remain ſo difficult to be found, that many Travellers die for thirſt; onely at the Sea ſide are Trenches, out of which the <hi>Arabians</hi> drink. And the Mountains, by reaſon of their exceſſive height, have their tops continually cover'd with Snow, and cloudy with Miſts and Fogs.</p>
                     <p>The Soil, for want of Moiſture, proves very barren,
<note place="margin">Conſtitution of the Soil.</note> producing nothing (as ſome write) but Dates; for indeed none take care to Sowe any Corn, or Plant Fruits. On the contrary,
<note place="margin">Beaſts.</note> in the Woods and Mountains breed many Bucks, Goats, Cows, Hogs, Catamountains, Wild Aſſes, Horſes, Camelions, Wild Hens, or Pheaſants, and Turtle-Doves.</p>
                     <p>But that which above all things makes this Iſland famous,
<note place="margin">Aloes Sicotrina.</note> is the Plant from which the <hi>Aloes Sicotrina</hi> cometh, and alſo for the great abundance of <hi>Dragons Blood</hi> brought thence, being no other than a Gum diſtilling from a Tree; the <hi>Indians</hi> call it <hi>Ber,</hi> and bruiſe it with an Iron in the growing Bark at a ſet time of the Year. The Sea-ſhore alſo produces much Ambergreece.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of this Iſland are <hi>Arabians,</hi> or Native <hi>Sicotrians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Several Inhabitants.</note> which laſt the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Beduins,</hi> and are divided into two Generations: The one,
<note place="margin">Nature.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Beduinſche</hi> Mothers, and <hi>Arabian Negro</hi> Fathers, keep at the Sea ſide, are black of Colour, curl'd Hair, tall of Stature, but very ill-favour'd: The others are unmix'd <hi>Beduins,</hi> and live within the Countrey, being whiter than Native <hi>Iudians.</hi> Some of them ſeem to have been born in <hi>Europe,</hi> by the tallneſs of their Statures, handſom Bodies, ſoundneſs of Conſtitution, and the Air of the Face; onely differing herein, that they let their Hair grow without cutting, which they ſuffer either to hang over their Necks and Shoulders, or elſe tie up or braid the ſame together behind. They are inconſtant, miſtruſtful,
<note place="margin">Conſtitution.</note> and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly; inſomuch that a handful of <hi>Arabians</hi> will awe vaſt Multitudes of them. They have a great fear of all other people, which makes them ſhun converſe with Foreigners, and are above meaſure lazy and idle, concerning themſelves in nothing but Fiſhing, and feeding their Cattel.</p>
                     <p>Their common Food is Milk, Butter, Dates, and Fleſh;
<note place="margin">Food.</note> but chiefly Milk boyl'd with Herbs, and ſerves them both for Diet and Phyſick. In ſtead of Rie, or Wheaten Bread, they uſe Rice, brought to them from other Places, and for want of that, eat Cakes made of Dates.</p>
                     <p>They wear certain Clothes by them call'd <hi>Cambolins,</hi> made of Bucks Hair,
<note place="margin">Apparel.</note> ſix Spans long and two broad, from their Girdle to their Knees, and over that another greater black and white Cloth, in form like a Cloke, which they wrap about from their Shoulders to their Knees, and never pull it off: <hi>Barboſa,</hi> on the contrary, writeth, That they go ſtark naked, onely with a Clout or Skin of a Beaſt before their Privacies, which <hi>Corſalis</hi> alſo affirms. Their Heads are bare, though <hi>Thevet</hi> ſaith they wear Shaſhes, as the <hi>Abyſsine</hi> Chriſtians. The Women wear the ſame <hi>Cambolins,</hi> and with it, from their Middle to their Feet, another great Mantle, without any thing on their Heads. Theſe, as we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd before, live in Holes and Caves, as the ancient <hi>Troglodites</hi> on the oppoſite Coaſt of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and ſleep on the Ground, upon Buck-skins; and their manner of Salutation conſiſts in the kiſſing one anothers Shoulders.</p>
                     <p>There are no Artiſts nor Handicrafts found amongſt them; onely every one knows how to Weave the foremention'd <hi>Cambolins,</hi> or Hair-Clothes. They are ignorant and brutiſh beyond compariſon; and as they know no better, ſo they hate to learn, and uſe no other Arithmetick than what they notch on Sticks.</p>
                     <p>The Men keep as many Women as they can maintain (though <hi>Oſarius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Marriage.</note> upon a wrong information, ſcarcely allows one Woman to a Man) and part from
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:56692:388"/>them when they think meet. When they have any Children, they may charge others with them, whom they pleaſe; and this nominated Father muſt receive and feed them as his own, and give them part of his Goods, as to his other Children. The Children thus given away, they call <hi>Children of Smoke;</hi> becauſe when the Men and the Women conclude to diſpoſe of a Child, they make a Fire at the Door of the Houſe with green Wood, and whilſt it begins to ſmoke, the Man runs out, crying with a loud voice, That the Child ſhall be given to ſuch a Man, whoſe Name they declare; and ſo the Father and Mother carry it to him, and he takes care for it, as we mention'd before.</p>
                     <p>The Names of the <hi>Beduin</hi>-Men are,
<note place="margin">The names of the men.</note> 
                        <hi>Lakaa, Sumaa, Xembe, Terremo, Xamaxana, Surrakaa,</hi> and other ſuch like; ſo that <hi>John de Barras</hi> ſeems to have been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform'd, who ſays, <hi>They take the Names of</hi> St. Thomas, <hi>and other Apoſtles:</hi> But all the Women are call'd <hi>Maria;</hi> not out of Honor or Reſpect to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but becauſe in their common Language <hi>Mary</hi> ſignifies <hi>A Woman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They never ſtay to wait for the dying of their ſick Friends;
<note place="margin">The <hi>Beduins</hi> kill their ſick.</note> but when they gueſs them paſt recovery, they kill them: For they ſay, <hi>That between being quite dead, and beginning to die, is no difference.</hi> When the ſick Perſons ſee their Ends approach, they call their Children and neareſt Relations, giving them many Counſels and Advices, among which the three following are moſt uſual. Firſt, <hi>That they ſhould receive or embrace no other Doctrine or Religion, than thoſe of their Forefathers.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>That they would not make themſelves familiar, or have to do with any one of another Countrey.</hi> The third, <hi>That they would take revenge of ſome Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which they name:</hi> Which laſt proves many times the occaſion of divers Murders. When any Perſon is purſu'd by another that intends to kill him, and he cannot eſcape, he takes and drinks the white Juyce of a Tree growing in this Iſland, being the ſtrongeſt Poyſon that can be found, and which they always carry about them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> of this Iſland,
<note place="margin">Trade.</note> according to the Relation of <hi>Pyrard,</hi> Trade to <hi>Goa, Arabia,</hi> and other Places, where they ſell their Dates and Rice, brought to them out of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> very curious Mats made of Date-tree Leaves, and great abundance of Myrrhe; and from thence the <hi>European</hi> Merchants bring <hi>Aloes Sicotrina,</hi> and <hi>Dragons Blood,</hi> vulgarly known among Apothecaries by the name of <hi>Sanguis Draconis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here are few Fortifications;
<note place="margin">Strength.</note> onely the King of <hi>Kaxem</hi> or <hi>Fartas</hi> erected a Fort or Bulwark, by the Village <hi>Tamara,</hi> with another of Stone on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Conquer'd under the Command of one <hi>Treſtan de Cunha,</hi> in the year Fifteen hundred ſix, or ſeven; who left it to the Charge of <hi>Alphonſo Norogue,</hi> with a ſtrong Garriſon of <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Soldiers: But the Iſland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, inſtigated by the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> to whom they were before bound in Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, broke their Promiſe made to the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> ſo that King <hi>Emanuel</hi> diſcerning the Nature of the People, and how the defending of this Fort coſt more than it was worth, commanded the ſame to be demoliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Their Arms are broad Hangers,
<note place="margin">Arms.</note> with great Hilts: At their Girdle they wear alſo a Knife, of about three fingers broad, and ſharp. The Hilts of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are cover'd with Silver or Copper, or wound about with Wyre very neatly. Some carry Shields, and ordinary Guns, in the uſe whereof they are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert.</p>
                     <p>The proper Language of theſe <hi>Beduins</hi> is ſo barbarous,

                     <p>The Government of this Iſland, according to <hi>Pyrard,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Government.</note> belongs to a peculiar <hi>Xeque,</hi> ſent thither by the <hi>Xerif</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and hath his aboad in <hi>Tamary.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the <hi>Turk</hi> poſſeſs'd this whole Iſle, by Conqueſt thereof in the year Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred thirty eight, at which time he made himſelf alſo Maſter of <hi>Aden.</hi> But the King of <hi>Kaxem,</hi> or <hi>Kajem,</hi> which ſome take to be the ſame with the King of <hi>Fartas,</hi> regain'd and held it, till the <hi>Xerif</hi> of <hi>Arabia</hi> won it from him, who ſends thither a <hi>Xeque</hi> to Rule as his Subſtitute.</p>
                     <p>For the deciding of Differences, determining of Criminal Cauſes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging Affairs of State, Judges, which they call <hi>Caciz,</hi> or <hi>Hodomas,</hi> are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from whom there is no Appeal. If any one has ſtoll'n a Buck or a Goat, out of neceſſity, or for meer hunger, he may, if he perceives the Owner of the Beaſt purſues him, fly to a Temple, by which he is clear'd; If coming to the Temple, and making a noiſe, another cometh to receive him, there may nothing further of prejudice be offer'd; but if none cometh to him, then they may pull him out, and cut off his Hand, alledging, <hi>That the Temple would not ſerve him for his defence, becauſe none would come to receive him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are ſome that to this time hold an opinion,

                     </p>
                     <p>They worſhip the Moon, becauſe they hold her to be the Mother and Cauſe of all things; and therefore in great Droughts they ſet one among them in a certain place, and make a Circle round about him, out of which he muſt not ſtir, upon pain of death, but there muſt continue ten days worſhipping the Moon; within which time if it doth not Rain, they cut off his Hand. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of <hi>Lent,</hi> all the moſt Eminent aſſemble, and offer Sacrifice to the Moon, of an hundred Goats and Kids Heads. They obſerve <hi>Lent</hi> like the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but they begin it with the New Moon in <hi>April,</hi> and keep the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity ſixty days; during which time they eat no Milk, Butter, Fleſh, nor Fiſh, but onely Herbs and Dates, or Rice and Honey, which they buy in the Cities of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> They are ſo zealous Obſervers of this Faſt, that if they find any to have broken it, for the firſt time they cut off two Fingers of his Right-hand; the ſecond time, the whole Hand; and the third time, the Arm.</p>
                     <p>Every Temple, of which there are many, hath a <hi>Caciz,</hi> call'd by them <hi>Hoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> that is, a Governor or Judge in Church-matters; but holds the Office but one Year, which he enters upon by receiving a Staff, the Badge of his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and wearing always a Croſs of a Span and half long about him, which he may not part with upon pain of the loſs of his Hand. In the Temples, whereinto at the Riſing and Setting of the Moon they enter, they uſe a Stick of two or three Spans long, upon which with another Stick they give certain Strokes, thrice in the Day, and thrice in the Night; held by them for a Work of great Holineſs: Afterwards they go in Proceſſion three times round about the Church-yard, turning thrice after every Circuit; then they take an Iron Pan, made in form of a plain deep Scale, hanging upon three Chains,
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:56692:389"/>into which they put Splinters of ſweet Wood, and hold the Baſon over the Fire: then they firſt perfume the Altar thrice, afterwards the Temple Doors, and ſay with a loud voice ſome Prayers in the Temple, and in the Church-yard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting of the Moon to do good to them onely, and no other People: At the performance of this Solemnity, the <hi>Hodamo</hi> holdeth upon the Altar a lighted Candle made of Butter (for they have none of Wax or Tallow;) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have in their Temples Diſhes of Butter, wherewith they alſo every day anoint the Croſs and other Sticks lying upon the Altar. They go upon a certain day of the year, with the greateſt Croſs, in Proceſſion round about the Temple, and cauſe it to be carry'd by one choſen out of the whole Aſſembly, whoſe Fingers after the ending of the Proceſſion they chop off, and preſent him with a little Stick, with certain marks upon it, for a token, that he ſhould be prejudic'd by no body; whereupon thenceforth he is held in much greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor than others.</p>
                     <p>They follow in many Churches the Ceremonies and Cuſtoms of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> becauſe they were for a long time Govern'd by Eccleſiaſtical Rulers which came from <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have no ſet-Day of the Week to go into their Temples, but aſſemble on the Proceſſion-days, or when any new occaſion calls them.</p>
                     <p>They are Circumcis'd like the <hi>Moors;</hi> and if they know any one that is not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcis'd, they cut off his Fingers; for no Uncircumcis'd may enter into their Temples: yea, the very Women themſelves clap their hands at their Husbands, if they be not Circumcis'd. They bear a great hatred againſt all <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſome are of opinion, that they have ſuck'd in much of the Hereſie of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and that formerly many were Converted by <hi>Francis Xavier.</hi>

                     <p>According to the Obſervations of Sir <hi>Thomas Roe,</hi> Ambaſſador from the King of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Perſia,</hi> there were in the Year Sixteen hundred and fifteen, upon this Iſland four ſorts of People, that is, <hi>Arabians,</hi> not Natives, but Shipt over thither, together with many others, by order of the King of <hi>Kaxem,</hi> when they ſubdu'd it. Theſe never appear before the <hi>Sultan</hi> without kiſſing his Hand. The ſecond ſort are a kind of Slaves, who labor continually in his ſervice, and prepare and dreſs the Aloes. The third are <hi>Beduins,</hi> the moſt antient Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, againſt whom a long time the King of <hi>Socotora</hi> made War.

Johannes de Caſtro,</hi> formerly Vice-Roy to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> affirms, that the red colour of this Sea, ariſeth from the great quantity of Corral growing at the bottom. Others, that the Rivers which pour into this in the midſt of Winter, having flow'd through Countreys of a red colour'd Earth, make the Water ſeem red, and conſequently gave it the Name.

                     <p>In this Sea befell the Miracle which the holy Scriptures mention, when <hi>Moſes</hi> with his Rod commanded a Way for the paſſage of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to the number of ſix hundred thouſand Men, (Women and Children not reckon'd:) and wherein <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in purſuit of them, as he ſuppoſed flying, twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot-Soldiers, and fifty thouſand Horſemen, were ſwallow'd.</p>
                     <p>In this Sea are many ſtrange and remarkable things, as Trees growing, Branches of Corral, Muſhroms, Meremaids, flying Fiſhes, and other wondrous Creatures. But how great diligence ſoever they have uſed, none could ever take any of them, although common, and at all times ſeen along the Coaſt; for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> believe, that they and theirs, by the killing ſuch a Creature, ſhould die within a year, as they ſay, they have found by experience. And out of that conceit, when in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty one, one was taken alive in the <hi>Nyle,</hi> by the City <hi>Roſetta,</hi> the <hi>Bey</hi> or Governor of the City, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it preſently to be put into the Water again, though a <hi>Venetian</hi> had bought it for five and twenty <hi>Piaſters,</hi> and rather than incur the hazard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd him his Money.</p>

                     <p>In ſome places of the Red-Sea, unpaſſable for its ſhallowneſs, they gather up a finer ſort of Corral than the common; eſpecially uſeful to be ſet in deep Caves and Grotts, becauſe it repreſents perfectly the ſhapes of little Trees, with great delight to the Eyes of curious beholders. In theſe Vegetables many times, by varying colours, or tranſparency, Nature plays and ſports it ſelf with great curioſity.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of theſe Parts paſs this Sea in little Barques, made of Planks joyn'd together, not with Nails, but certain Pitcht Towe.</p>
                     <p>Many Commodities are brought in theſe Boats to <hi>Cairo,</hi> which the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors take in pieces afterwards, and ſell the Planks at dear Rates, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home by Land to their Houſes.</p>
                     <p>This way of building Boats without Iron-Nails, ſeems to be no Novelty, conſidering <hi>Strabo</hi> the Geographer many Ages ſince ſpeaks of Leather-Boats, uſed by the <hi>Arabians</hi> for paſtime in the Red-Sea: As alſo of ſome other made of Oſiers and Bruſh-wood, with which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> paſſed over the <hi>Nyle.</hi>

It is ſo high and ſtrong a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Situation, that <hi>Alvarez, Godignus,</hi> and <hi>Sanutus,</hi> report it fifteen days Journey round at the Foot, and aloft at the top ſome few Miles in compaſs; being every where, from beneath to above, as it were cut ſtreight up like a Wall, having onely three or four troubleſom Avenues to it. <hi>Godignus</hi> makes this Rock circular, and places on the top a Plain a mile long, with one only Building, and that not very ſtately; and avers, That they have no Water, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves of Rain kept in Ciſterns cut in the Rocks: But <hi>Sanutus</hi> adds a Cloyſter of St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, with eighty ſix Monks, and ſtores it with Sheep, Hens, Geeſe, and Fruit-Trees: And further, this we dare avouch, contrary to the Fictions of <hi>Urrettes,</hi> and others, That the Emperor hath neither a Library, nor Treaſury for Gold or Precious Stones there; neither doth any Penalty fall upon a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or other, entring into it.</p>
               <p>Southerly from <hi>Bar-Dambea</hi> lie the Mountains of <hi>Gafale,</hi> by ſome miſtaken for the <hi>Mountains of the Moon.</hi>

               <p>The Air in moſt Places, by the Report of <hi>Godignus,</hi> hath a moſt healthful Temperature, being ſweetly cooled and refreſhed by gentle and freſh Briezes; but in the lower and Southerly Places, by the ſcorching heat of the Sun, it grows more malignant. In the Kingdom of <hi>Tigre, Jarrik</hi> highly extols the goodneſs of the Air: For (ſaith he) although it lie under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> yet the continual blowing of the North-winds (there not cold) ſo clears it, that many exceeding old People, very freſh, and ſtrong of Limbs, are found there.

               <p>Their Beaſts of Game are Wild Boars, Elephants, Buffles, Lions, Leopards, Tygres, Rhinocerots, and <hi>Giraffi</hi> of an extraordinary bigneſs; Deer, Civet-cats, Wild Goats, ſmall Oxen and Cows, ſo wild and ſalvage, that they ſeem not tamable, having little Horns, ſtanding ſo looſe upon the Skin, that they move them as their Ears; Wolves, Catamountains, Harts, Badgers, and very great Apes.</p>
               <p>They have innumerable Fowl and Poultrey; as Hens and Cocks, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges with yellow Feet and grey Bills; tame and wild Storks, tame and wild Ducks, Pigeons, Quails, and Turtle-Doves, Paraketoes and Cuccows, Eagles, Falcons, Sparrow-Hawks, Kites, Herons, and Cranes. Moreover here are too many noxious Inſects, eſpecially of Graſhoppers, which not only eat up and deſtroy the Graſs of the Field, but the Leaves of Trees, and ſometimes ſwarm in ſuch innumerable Multitudes, that they cover the Earth, and for ſome Miles together darken the Sun: They are large like Crickets, with yellow Wings.</p>

               <p>The Common People go cloſe trimm'd, without Beards or Muſtachioes; but the Prieſts go with ſhaven Heads, and a long Beard. The uſual Clothing of the Inferior Rank is Cotton; but the Rich go in Silk, brought them from <hi>India, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi>

               <p>The King wears a Robe of Purple, with a Crown upon his Head, ſet with Precious Stones: or, as <hi>Sanutus</hi> tells us, half of Gold, and half of Silver, with a Croſs in his Hand, and Watchet Taffaty before his Face, which he ſometimes lifts up, and lets fall again. His Coat is border'd with Gold, and hemm'd with Silk, with wide Sleeves. The Queen goes habited in white <hi>Indian</hi> Silk Stuff, cover'd over with a light Silk Mantle, with a kind of a Mask before her Face.</p>

               <p>They have no common Coyn in uſe, but pay their Silver and Gold by weight, in ſmall pieces; yet in ſome places they ſhew a ſtrange Coyn of Gold, ſtamped with <hi>Arabick</hi> Letters. <hi>Jarrik</hi> ſays, they uſe Salt in ſtead of Money; and <hi>Pinto</hi> gives to the <hi>Abyſsines, Oquea's</hi> of Gold, whereof every one makes twelve <hi>Portugueſe Cruſadoes.</hi>

               <p>They have good Markets for Trade, wherein the chiefeſt Dealers are Prieſts,
<note place="margin">Trade.</note> exchanging Corn or Salt, againſt Cattel, Fowl, and other Commodities: but the deareſt Merchandiſes are Frankincenſe, Pepper, and Myrrhe, which they barter for Gold.</p>
               <p>Their Arms are Lances or Darts, and Back-ſwords.
<note place="margin">Arms.</note> They uſe many Bowes and Arrows, but not with Feathers. For defence they put on Helmets, and very ſtrong round Shields. Pieces of Cannon and Muskets they bought of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> at a dear Rate; yet uſe for the moſt part Darts, Arrows, and Slings. The Horſe-men, in whom their greateſt Strength conſiſts, wear long Coats of Mail, which come down to their Knees, cloſe Helmets, and round Shields, with Scymitars and Lances. They that go without a Helmet to the Wars, cover their Heads with red Hair Caps, like thoſe of the <hi>Mamalucks</hi> in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> They provide themſelves alſo with Elephants, Arm'd, and loaden with Towers; and have Copper Trumpets and Drums, brought thither from <hi>Cairo,</hi> with other Drums of Wood, cover'd over with a Skin, as among us.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Abyſsine</hi> hath many Enemies; but chiefly upon one ſide the <hi>Turk,</hi> who planted themſelves along the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and not only wreſted that whole Coaſt from him, but lends his other Enemies great Aſſiſtance. On the other ſide lieth the Emperor of <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> who continually keeps his Realm in Arms. The King of <hi>Congo</hi> neighbors cloſe by that of <hi>Goyame,</hi> who is ſaid to have kept himſelf quiet ſince he made Peace with King <hi>David.</hi> But the moſt dangerous and ſtrongeſt Enemies are the <hi>Galas,</hi> or <hi>Galles,</hi> as the <hi>Abyſsines</hi> call them, who in the foregoing Age have bereaved the <hi>Abyſsines</hi> of a third part of their Dominions: But thoſe of <hi>Tigrai</hi> have oftentimes worſted them, and eſpecially in the year Sixteen hundred and ſeven.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Preſter-John</hi> doth intend to make War againſt the <hi>Nubians,</hi> or any other People, he cauſes a Cloth, in form of a Banner, to be carried on the top of a Lance, to proclaim the War through all the Countrey.</p>

Amongſt thoſe which firſt introduced the Word <hi>Belulgian</hi> here in <hi>Europe,</hi> was one <hi>Zagarab,</hi> an Ambaſſador ſent from the Emperor of the <hi>Abyſsines</hi> to <hi>John</hi> the third, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abyſsine,</hi> call'd <hi>Peter,</hi> who at the ſame time accompanied <hi>Francois Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Prieſt, as Ambaſſador to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh. The firſt caus'd <hi>Damaiaco a Goez,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> to miſtake the Name, aſſerting that <hi>Belulgian</hi> is a compound word of <hi>Belul</hi> and <hi>Gian,</hi> the firſt ſignifies <hi>Precious,</hi> and the other <hi>John,</hi> as if they would hint by that Name, that there was nothing more precious than the <hi>Abyſsines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others would have it, that <hi>Preſter-John</hi> was a corrupt word, of <hi>Pharaſta-Jan,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>A Lyon on Horſeback,</hi> becauſe this Emperor is ſaid to exceed all the Kings of <hi>Africa,</hi> as the Lyon excells all the Beaſts. They give alſo the Title of Lyon, becauſe deſcended from the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> alledging that he had <hi>Meliloc</hi> for his Predeceſſor, that is, <hi>King of Excellency,</hi> Son of <hi>Makeda,</hi> Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> which came to hear the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is certain the Name of <hi>Preſter-John</hi> neither proceeded from <hi>Belulgian,</hi> nor <hi>Beldigian,</hi> nor <hi>Pharaſta-Jan,</hi> or from any other ſuch like <hi>Abyſsine</hi> Word; but it was by accidentally apply'd to the <hi>Abyſsine</hi> Emperor, when he firſt of all began to be known to the King of <hi>Portugal:</hi> But the better to diſcover the truth we muſt obſerve, that as the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> were by a general Name firſt call'd <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Ptolomies;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Perſia, Xerxes,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Sofi;</hi> the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Kings, <hi>Xeriffs;</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, <hi>Caeſars;</hi> ſo is alſo the Name of <hi>Preſter-John,</hi> a general Name, and ſignifies a Royal Title, or Dignity of ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, who Reigned a very long time ago.</p>
               <p>But theſe <hi>Preſter-Johns</hi> have not Reigned in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> or in any other part of <hi>Africa,</hi> as many imagine, contrary to the opinion of the moſt experienced Geographers, who unanimouſly agree they Reign'd in <hi>Aſia;</hi> yet in what Place not fully known: for ſome making them to have been Kings of <hi>Cathay,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth greater doubt and obſcurity, by reaſon that in the next following years it came to be known, that <hi>Cathay</hi> belong'd to <hi>China,</hi> as <hi>Matthias Riccius,</hi> and after that, <hi>Benedictus Goez,</hi> both Jeſuits, and next them ſeveral others have found: But beſides the Tract of Land by the Name of <hi>Cathay,</hi> plac'd within the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>China, Godignus,</hi> and with him <hi>Kircher,</hi> judge it to be probable, that there is yet a greater Countrey about the <hi>Aſiatick, Scythia, Seres, Maſſagetania,</hi> and other neighboring People, bordering in the South and Weſt at the Confines of <hi>China,</hi> which had the Name of <hi>Cathay,</hi> of which many years ago <hi>Preſter-John</hi> had the Dominion.</p>
               <p>This Countrey <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calls <hi>Scythia,</hi> beyond the Mountain <hi>Imaus,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants <hi>Dalanguer</hi> and <hi>Negrecet,</hi> begins at the Foot of <hi>Mount Taurus,</hi> and ſpreads to the <hi>Icy Sea,</hi> dividing <hi>Scythia</hi> in two. <hi>Paulus Marcus</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> calls it <hi>The Dominion of the great Cham;</hi> and the holy Scripture, according to the teſtimony of <hi>Arias Montanus, Gog and Magog.</hi>

               <p>In all this far ſpreading Countrey of <hi>Cathay,</hi> one may ſee, that this ſuppoſed moſt mighty Emperor, <hi>Preſter-John,</hi> had the Dominion over ſeventy two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, partly <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and partly <hi>Heathens,</hi> though by the great numbers of Kingdoms he hath gotten many Names, to the great diſtraction both of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Geographers: For ſome make him to be one and the ſame with the great <hi>Cham,</hi> others call him <hi>Aſhid;</hi> ſome with the <hi>Abyſsines</hi> call him <hi>Juchanes Belul,</hi> that is <hi>Precious John.</hi> Some, as <hi>Godignus,</hi> with no improbable Reaſons, will have it, that by his Subjects, for their high eſteem of the Prophet <hi>Jonas,</hi> he is call'd <hi>Joanne,</hi> a Name common to all thoſe that ever did poſſeſs this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; though in theſe Weſtern Parts he is commonly call'd by the <hi>Latin Churches, Joannes,</hi> with the additional ſurname of <hi>Preſter,</hi> not that he ever was a Prieſt, but becauſe, according to the Cuſtom of the Arch-biſhop, in the time of Peace had a Croſs carried before him at his going out; but ontring upon the Wars, two Croſs-bearers went before him, the one with a Croſs of Gold, and the other with a Croſs beſet with Precious Stones, for a token of his defending the Worſhip of God: for which reaſon <hi>Scaliger</hi> derives his Name from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Word <hi>Preſtigiani,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>Apoſtolick;</hi> which the <hi>Europeans</hi> underſtanding amiſs, call'd him in ſtead of <hi>Preſtigiani, Preſter-John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many years did this Kingdom of <hi>Preſter-John</hi> flouriſh in <hi>Aſia,</hi> till it fell to one <hi>David,</hi> who by one of his ſupreme Commanders call'd <hi>Cinge,</hi> choſen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror by the Army and the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who in ſtead of <hi>Preſter</hi> ſtyl'd him <hi>Uncam:</hi> In the Year Eleven hundred ſeventy eight it was overcome in Battel; whereby the glory of this Empire, and the Name of <hi>Preſter-John</hi> came in effect to an end, to the great loſs and prejudice of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> But by what miſtake the Name of <hi>Preſter-John</hi> came to the Emperor of <hi>Abyſsine,</hi> we will in brief declare: When the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> with their Fleets were buſie in diſcovering ſtrange Countreys, there was a great noyſe through all <hi>Europe,</hi> of <hi>Preſter-John</hi> and his Excellency, reported a moſt powerful Emperor, Lord of many Kings, and of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, but unknown in what place he had his abode. For which cauſe when <hi>Pike Kovillan,</hi> ſent by <hi>John</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> firſt over the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Sea,</hi> and afterwards by Land, to ſeek out this Prince, coming into <hi>India,</hi> and hearing, that in <hi>Abyſsine,</hi> or that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> which lieth below <hi>Egypt,</hi> was a great and powerful Prince, who profeſſed the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, he went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:56692:403"/>and finding many things in him which was reported of the true <hi>Preſter-John,</hi> he took him for the ſame Perſon, and was the firſt that call'd him by that Name, which others that went the enſuing year into <hi>Abyſsine,</hi> follow'd, and ſo eaſily brought the miſtake into <hi>Europe,</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Abyſsine</hi> being ever ſince call'd <hi>Preſter-John:</hi> Yet <hi>Damianus</hi> a <hi>Goez,</hi> in his Book of the Nature and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Abyſsines,</hi> poſitively denies that the King of <hi>Abyſsine</hi> was ever call'd <hi>Preſter-John;</hi> ſo that in truth that Name properly belongs to the foremention'd Prince of <hi>Aſia:</hi> But ſeeing that Cuſtom hath almoſt made it a Law, and the Kingdom of <hi>Preſter-John</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> already overwhelm'd, the Name of <hi>Preſter-John</hi> may conveniently be applied and fixed upon the <hi>Abyſsine</hi> King of <hi>Africa,</hi> profeſſing the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>Every Subſtitute Kingdom, as <hi>Tigre, Gambea, Goiame, Amara, Narea,</hi> hath a Deputy to Rule it in the Name of the Emperor; and the like hath every Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory: Beſides, the Vice-Roy of <hi>Tigre</hi> bears the Title <hi>Tigra Mahon,</hi> and muſt always be of the Royal Stock. Him of the Countrey next to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> they ſtile <hi>Barnagas,</hi> that is, <hi>King of the Sea;</hi> not that he properly Commands over the Countreys by the Sea, for they are under the <hi>Turks,</hi> but becauſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey over which he Commands, lieth nearer to Sea than any other part of <hi>Tigre.</hi> He hath his abode moſt in the City <hi>Barva</hi> or <hi>Debaroa,</hi> and winneth great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as well among his own People as Strangers.</p>
               <p>The Government of the Kingdom is adminiſtred with Diſcretion and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which hath advanced the honor of the King both at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>The Judges ſhew great ſeverity in puniſhing Offenders, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral qualities of their Crimes, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as ſhrink from the right and true Faith, and change their Opinion, the People ſtone to death; but thoſe which totally Apoſtatize, or blaſpeme God and the Ghoſt, are publickly burn'd alive; Murderers they deliver to the neareſt Relations of the Murthered, to revenge themſelves on him according to their pleaſure: Thieves have their Eyes put out, and afterwards by Judgment are appointed for Slaves of the Empire, and given to the Guides, with whom they may go all the Countrey over, to earn their Living by Singing and Playing on Inſtruments; but with this Proviſo, not to ſtay above one day in a place, upon penalty of loſing their lives. Other ſmall Offences they puniſh with Whipping.</p>
               <p>In the Succeſſion of the Crown, the eldeſt takes place after the Father, but for want of Iſſue-male, the moſt worthy Perſon of the next in Blood is choſen. Others affirm, that Seniority creates no Claim, but that the Crown falls to him whom the Father makes choice of on his Death-bed; but that ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, becauſe the intended Succeſſor lives at large in the Courts, whereas the reſt are kept on the Mountain <hi>Amara;</hi> and if he die, another, whom the greateſt at the Court do judge fitteſt for the Crown, is ſent for out.</p>
               <p>The great and famous Iſland <hi>Meroe</hi> lies divided between three Kings, which oftentimes War with one another; the firſt is a <hi>Mahumetan Moor;</hi> the ſecond, an Idolater, deſcended from the Blood of the right <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> the third, a <hi>Chriſtian Abyſsine,</hi> and acknowledges that King for his Lord.</p>

               <p>The Queen-Mother <hi>Nazarena,</hi> ſeeing this miſhap in her Family, ariſen by the death of the King her Husband, and that Prince <hi>Suſneos,</hi> the new King, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſuppreſs all thoſe whom his Predeceſſor had favored, inſtantly ſent her Sons notice of their Fathers death, ordering them to retire from <hi>Meroe</hi> to ſome faithful Friends of the Emperor their late Father: And to that end ſhe ſent them much Gold and rich Jewels to maintain them, and to raiſe ſome Troops to revenge the death of their Father.</p>

<pb n="653" facs="tcp:56692:405"/>with the number of fifty Servants; for all the other, fearing the weariſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Way, left him; then he came into <hi>Egypt</hi> to the City <hi>Corrigia,</hi> and laſtly to <hi>Grand Cair,</hi> where he was well receiv'd by the <hi>Copticks,</hi> and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably entertain'd by the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> for the ſpace of two days: Thence he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, ſcarce accompanied with fifteen Servants (for the other remain'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of wearineſs and ſickneſs, in <hi>Cair</hi>) to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> into which he came at the <hi>Purification,</hi> in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty and two.

But after the Diviſion of the World among the Apoſtles, they ſay, the <hi>Abyſsines</hi> fell to <hi>St. Matthew,</hi> who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd a rich harveſt of Souls there.</p>
               <p>Afterwards this People, together with the <hi>Copticks,</hi> receiv'd the Doctrine and Errors of <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> and <hi>Eutiches,</hi> and elected a Patriarch to overſee the Church, who hath his chief Reſidence in the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and appoints a Subſtitute in <hi>Abyſsine</hi> nam'd <hi>Eteche,</hi> or <hi>Chomos,</hi> who hath many Biſhops under him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Abyſsines</hi> (captivated with the deſtructive Opinions of <hi>Eutiches</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus</hi>) believe, That the Souls of the Saints, after their death, do not go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to Heaven, but to the terreſtrial Paradice, to remain there till the day of Judgment; That the Wicked do not go immediately to Hell, but to a place near adjacent, in which they can ſee the Puniſhment prepared for them, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mean while for the day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damianus</hi> a <hi>Goez</hi> affirms, that they conclude a Purgatory, and believe that the Souls of the vertuous are not plagued there on Saturdays and Sundays, and that Alms-deeds do exceedingly ſerve for the mitigating of their pain; but deny that their <hi>Eteche,</hi> or Patriarch, can grant Souls any liberty to go out, judging that onely to belong to God, who hath limited, or ſet the time of their puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Godignus</hi> affirms, that Children are Baptiz'd with Fire and Water, imprinting a Mark upon their Foreheads, which they muſt carefully keep; for they hold it fit to follow the Rule which the Forerunner of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeems to have Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:56692:406"/>when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall baptize you in the Spirit and in Fire;</hi> but others think, that the firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Kings of <hi>Abyſsine</hi> did it to diſtinguiſh the Believers from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
               <p>Between the Religion or Worſhip of the <hi>Egyptians, Copticks,</hi> and <hi>Abyſsines,</hi> there is no difference at all; for both theſe People perform the Maſs in the ſame manner, and conſent in the Church Ceremonies, which they obſerve in the Conſecration of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which they perform in this manner: The Prieſt at the appointed hour comes into the Church, and when the People are aſſembled, in his Prieſtly Veſtments aſcends to the Altar, the Deacon crying with a loud voyce in the <hi>Coptick</hi> Tongue, <hi>Bleſſed be the Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> whereupon the Prieſt, turning to the People, with a loud voyce often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats theſe words, <hi>Chriſt be with us all,</hi> and the the People anſwer, <hi>And with thy ſpirit;</hi> After ſeveral Ceremonies perform'd, with Songs of Praiſe and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and at laſt Prayers being ended, the Prieſt bleſſeth the Cover, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or Cup, the Spoon and Shrine, or Coffer of the Sacrament, by which they underſtand, <hi>The Ark of the Covenant,</hi> as by the Spoon, <hi>The Spear of Christ,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Participation, with ſtretched out hands, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Partaker of the Divine Subſtance, who art im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate, together with the Father and holy Spirit, our Father, our Lord, our God, and our Redeemer: Thou art that Bread which deſcended from Heaven; Thou who art come to be a Lamb without blemiſh, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and life of the World, we ask and pray thy Deity, that thou wilt ſet thy Countenance upon this holy Myſtery, upon this Bread and upon this Cup, which we Prieſts do ſet upon this Table: Bleſs, ſanctifie, cleanſe, and tranſmute this Bread into thy holy Body, and this Wine in this Cup, into thy holy and precious Blood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner ſays the <hi>Abyſsine</hi> Prieſt:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Our Prince Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Subſtance is not created, but thou art the pure Word: Thou art the Son of the Father; Thou art the Bread of Life, come down from Heaven; Thou wert before thou cameſt in the ſimilitude of an immaculate Lamb for the redemption of Sinners. Now, O thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Mankind, we humbly beſeech thy Majeſty to ſhew thy favorable Countenance and Benediction upon this Bread, and upon this Cup on this Altar; Bleſs, ſanctifie, purifie, and tranſmute this Bread into thy undefiled Fleſh, and this Wine into thy precious Blood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the reſt, they uſe one and the ſame manner of Incenſe, and the ſame words of Conſecration, the ſame form of Confeſſion, and the ſame words of Adoration.</p>
               <p>In the Conſecration of the Body and Blood of our Saviour, both theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple obſerve one and the ſame Ceremonies. The <hi>Abyſsine</hi> expreſſeth it with a loud voyce thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He ſtretcheth out his hands to the feeble; He is become weak, that he may ſtrengthen thoſe that wait upon him: who the ſame Night wherein he was betray'd, took Bread into his holy and immaculate Hands, looked up to heaven to his Father; he gave thanks, bleſſing and ſanctifying it, and gave to his Diſciples, ſaying, Take and eat ye all of it: This Bread is my Fleſh, which is given for the remiſſion of ſins. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the People ſay:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Verily, verily, verily, we believe, and truſt, and love thee, O Lord our God.</q> This we believe in truth is thy Fleſh.</p>
               <pb n="655" facs="tcp:56692:406"/>
               <p>Then ſaith the Prieſt again:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In like manner he took the Cup, and gave thanks, bleſſed and ſanctifi'd it, and ſaid to them, Take and drink ye all of it: This is the Cup of my Blood which ſhall be ſhed for you, for the redemption of many.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the People anſwer:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Verily, verily, verily, we believe, and truſt, and love thee, O Lord our God.</q> This we believe in truth is thy Blood.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner it is done by the <hi>Copticks.</hi> That the <hi>Coptick</hi> and <hi>Abyſsine</hi> Church hath been one and the ſame from all Antiquity, <hi>Nicephorus, Zonoras, Cedrenus,</hi> and laſtly the <hi>Abyſsine</hi> Rituals themſelves, do teſtifie; for the common Liturgy, the Admonition that is made of Praying for the welfare of the <hi>Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine</hi> Church, for the King and Princes of the Empire, Judges and Subjects, there is alſo in particular made mention of the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Pray for our Prince, and our Patriarch, <hi>N. N.</hi> Lord and Head of the Biſhops of the great Territory of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and for our Reverend Arch-Biſhop <hi>Mark,</hi> the Head of our Countrey, and for all Biſhops, Prieſts, and true believing Miniſters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In other Admonitions, the Evangeliſt <hi>Mark, Theon, Petrus, Alexander, Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Theophilus, Cyrillus,</hi> and other Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria</hi> are remembred; which abundantly ſhew, that the <hi>Egyptian, Coptick,</hi> and <hi>Abyſsine,</hi> are in effect but one Church. The <hi>Abyſsine</hi> and <hi>Coptick</hi> are under one and the ſame Patriarch, who hath his Reſidence in <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in <hi>Abyſsine</hi> hath a Subſtitute under him, the Head in Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, there call'd <hi>Eteche,</hi> as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>This Man is choſen by the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or by the Monks of <hi>Abyſsine,</hi> and confirm'd by the Patriarch. His chiefeſt Office conſiſts in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of holy or ſacred Orders (though the beſtowing of Church-Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>Xeques,</hi> or King) and the puniſhing the obſtinate, ſuch as ſtand in contempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Godignus,</hi> againſt the opinion of many, maintains they have no Biſhops; but others, that the <hi>Eteche</hi> hath twelve Suffragans under him.</p>
               <p>A Clerk may have one Wife, but is not made Prieſt till three years after that. After the death of the firſt Wife no Prieſt may Marry again, but by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial conſent of the <hi>Eteche;</hi> yet then he may never celebrate Maſs any more: a matter ſo ſeverely obſerved by them, that they do not ſo much as touch a Candle Conſecrated for the Church.</p>
               <p>If a Clerk or Prieſt get a Baſtard-Child, they inſtantly put him out of his Office; and if he dies without lawful Children, his Goods Eſcheat to the King.</p>
               <p>They have many Monks, which follow the Rules of <hi>St. Anthony, St. Maccair,</hi> and <hi>St. Baſil:</hi> They accommodate themſelves every where to the Clergy, which they boldly viſit, do great Penance, live ſoberly, and Faſt often.</p>
               <p>All the Clergy, to the very <hi>Eteche,</hi> and Biſhops, dwell in Cloyſters, in the Cities, and in the Wilderneſſes: they go bare-foot, never eat Fleſh, nor drink Wine, and do beſides unuſual ſevere Penance: for beſides Faſting, they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelves terribly, by being bound to a Croſs, and ſo ſet for a whole day broyling in the Sun. Others go ſtark naked up to the neck into a cool Brook, and ſtay there till they are half dead.</p>
               <p>Some, which they call <hi>The Clergy of Libela,</hi> for a Penance carry two four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:56692:407"/>pieces of Lead of fifty or ſixty pound weight, which hang before their Breaſts, and behind their Backs, with which ſo about them they fall upon their Knees, with their Foreheads upon the Ground, ſo that many times their Heads ſwell, and their Bodies grow all black and blue. Others ſit with a great Stone about their Necks, which ſo bows down their Heads that they cannot look up to Heaven, nor move themſelves from the places where they are.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Abyſsines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Circumciſion.</note> as well Clergy as Temporality, are Circumciſed the eighth day after their Birth, and Baptiz'd the fortieth, but the Daughters the ſixtieth: and afterwards in their ſixth year are Re-baptiz'd with Fire in this manner: They take a ſharp Iron, which cuts on both ſides, and making it red hot in the Fire, ſet therewith upon the very tip of their Noſe two Marks, to diſtinguiſh them from <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who are alſo Circumciſed.</p>
               <p>The Water of Baptiſm they Conſecrate with many Ceremonies and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; with which they renew their Baptiſm every year upon the Day of the <hi>Three Kings,</hi> becauſe upon that day <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Baptized.</p>
               <p>The Confeſſion of their ſins they ſay they have by Apoſtolical command, which they make ſtanding; after which they receive Abſolution. <hi>Godignus</hi> avers, that they neither make known the particulars, nor the number of their ſins, but ſay onely in general, <hi>Habeſſen, Habeſſen,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>I have ſinn'd, I have ſinn'd.</hi> They hold onely five mortal ſins, fixing upon the laſt Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which excludes out of the holy City, Sorcerers, Fornicators or Adulterers, Murderers, Idolaters and Lyars. They acknowledge but five Commandments, imply'd by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in theſe Negatives:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have been hungry, and ye have not fed me; I have been thirſty, and you have not given me drink; I have been a ſtranger, and you have not let me in; I have been naked, and you have not clothed me; I have been ſick, and you have not viſited me; I have been in priſon, and you have not come to me:</hi> Believing that <hi>Christ</hi> will ſay to Reprobates onely theſe words at the laſt Day.</p>
               <p>They perform Maſs daily, yet no more but one in every Church, and that uſually in the Evening, an hour and a half before the going down of the Sun, except on <hi>Saturdays</hi> and <hi>Sundays.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ordinarily bury their Dead with a Croſs and Prayers, reading over them the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>St. John,</hi> the next day give ſome Alms for the benefit of their Souls.</p>
               <p>They Faſt every <hi>Wedneſday,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Damian Goez.</note> in remembrance of the Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was held upon that day: and every <hi>Friday,</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> eating nothing before the going down of the Sun; obſerving beſides with other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſeveral other times of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence.</p>
               <p>Some of the Clergy in the Cloyſters always eat Fleſh, becauſe they lie far from the Sea, and have no Lakes nor Rivers, out of which to take Fiſh. Others eat on Faſting-days but onely an Apple, with Bread and Water, or elſe ſome Herbs boyl'd, without Oyl or Butter; and ſome onely Bread and Water. Such as eat Fiſh, in ſome Places will touch nothing that hath any Bloud, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with Graſhoppers, Oyſters, Lobſters, and the like. Alſo they uſe upon Faſting-days a Grain call'd <hi>Camfa,</hi> and another <hi>Tebba,</hi> both prepar'd and made ready like Muſtard.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the <hi>Abyſsines</hi> have made defection from their antient Opinions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to have the true Doctrine, and the Pope to be <hi>Christ</hi>'s Vicar: for in the time of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh, <hi>Prester-John</hi> ſent to
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:56692:407"/>acknowledge him High-Prieſt, with promiſe of obedience to him and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: and all that have ſucceeded him have done the ſame, till the Year Sixteen hundred and nine, when the Prince of <hi>Narel, Jacob,</hi> infected with the Errors of <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> and <hi>Eutiches,</hi> got the Crown. After him the Son of <hi>Zaga-Christ,</hi> who in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty and three, ſtept into the Throne, embraced the ſame Opinions, ſo that he put out of the City all thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and obeyed the Pope.

It groweth to the heighth of a Pomegranate-Tree, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Branches, and but few Leaves, reſembling a Reed; for at firſt they appear rowl'd up together, but afterwards ſpread themſelves wide, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſix or ſeven Yards in length, and almoſt one in breadth, ſo that any may ſhelter themſelves from the ſcorching of the Sun under one of them, which ſome make a ſtrong argument to prove, that with the Leaves of this Tree the Father of Mankind cover'd himſelf in <hi>Eden,</hi> upon the diſcovery of his nakedneſs. The Fruit reſembles a ſmall Cucumber, but hangs together in Bunches: the Rhind of a Gold-yellow colour, lovely to look on, and fragrant in ſmell. The Fruit within ſomewhat like that of a Cucumber, but tender, juicy, ſweet, without Stones or Kernels, and wondrous delicious to ſuch as uſe to eat it.</p>

                  <p>The Water of this River, about a mile up in the Countrey, is always brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; and at the Mouth makes a Lake or Pool call'd <hi>Ambove,</hi> of a large half mile broad, and deep enough to bear a Ship.</p>
                  <p>It feeds many Crocodiles, as all the other Rivers of this Iſland.</p>

                  <p>Nature hath alſo ſtor'd this Iſland with many kinds of Plants, as well for Food as Phyſick; as firſt the nutrimental are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Rice of two ſorts, the one call'd in the Countrey phraſe <hi>Varemanghe,</hi> and the other <hi>Vatomandre:</hi> The firſt being of four ſorts, two of them are Bearded and very white; the other two ſorts Bearded, with a red Shell, that turns ruſſet when it is boyl'd.</p>
                  <p>The Rice <hi>Vatomandre</hi> grows never but in Winter; is ſmaller than the other, and ſowriſh of taſte.</p>
                  <p>The Rice <hi>Varehondre,</hi> differenc'd onely by the name.</p>

Theſe are the Canes they cut up and burn, to make a Compoſt of their Aſhes, to inrich the Grounds intended for Planting of Rice. The Fruit (which it bears not till the third year) is of the thickneſs of a ſmall Bean, whereof perhaps good Meal might be made. This Plant yields no leſs profit to the Iſlanders, then the <hi>Coco</hi>-Nuts do to the <hi>Indians;</hi> for they make thereof Pots to boyl Rice in, Pails, or Veſſels to fetch Water in, Wine and Beer Flasks, Knives, Violins and Harps, Rice-Meaſures, Tobacco-pipes, Tinder-boxes, ſmall Skiffs, for two Men to ſit in, and row up and down in the Rivers; Roofs of Houſes, Planks, and Stairs; and likewiſe <hi>Palanquins,</hi> or Sedans, wherein the Grandees of the Countrey are carried; for which purpoſe it is bended in its growth, to make theſe Chairs the eaſier.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ampoufoutchy</hi> is a Wood extraordinary light, white, and eaſie to be wrought. Of the Bark they make Ropes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amaze</hi> is a Tree thick in Body, but ſhoots up aloft tapering like a Pyramide: The Fruit contains a white Marrow, with many hard Kernels within, like the Seeds of a Pine-apple.</p>

                     <hi>Tanevoule</hi> is a Tree whoſe Leaves grow round about the Branches; without Stalks, very long and narrow, as if they were glew'd to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Onuvane,</hi> a ſort of knotty Cane, like the <hi>Indian.</hi> The Root they account good Meat; and the Wood being Violet-colour, Dyes Red. Beſides theſe, are many others found, which are much like the <hi>European,</hi> and ſeem to be one and the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The Countrey of <hi>Alfiſſack</hi> produces many Wild Grapes; but the Inhabitants do not eat them, being ignorant of their goodneſs. Good Tobacco grows all over the Countrey, and Hemp, there call'd <hi>Ahetſmanga Ahetsboule,</hi> which <hi>Flaccourt</hi> affirms both in Stalk, Leaf, and Seed, not to differ from that of <hi>Europe.</hi> This Hemp (ſaith the ſame <hi>Flaccourt</hi>) the Inhabitants plant with great diligence, and the dry'd Leaf they take in ſtead of Tobacco, which hath a ſtupifying quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cauſing Drowſineſs, Sleep; and pleaſant Dreams. Thoſe that are not us'd to take it, like two or three days together as if they were diſtracted; and therefore none but old Women, and the <hi>Ombiaſſen,</hi> that is, the Soothſayers, or Prieſts, and Learned Men, take of it. In the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> they have a like ſort of Plant call'd <hi>Bangue,</hi> and producing the ſame Effects; but the Stalk is thrown away, and uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There grows alſo <hi>Taikombelahe,</hi> or Purſlain, Cabbage, Radiſh, Dill, <hi>Turky</hi>-Wheat, <hi>Toughes,</hi> or Muſtard-ſeed, and <hi>Datura,</hi> or Thorn-apple.</p>
                  <p>As this Iſland boaſts ſo wonderful a fertility of Plants,
<note place="margin">Beaſts.</note> ſo it is alſo ſtor'd with great numbers of ſeveral kinds of Beaſts, Vermin, Fowl, and Fiſhes.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of Oxen; ſome with Horns; others without Horns, and round Heads, call'd <hi>Bouri;</hi> and the third with hanging or looſe Horns, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſtned to the Skin. All theſe have great Lumps of Fat behind in their Necks, of which the Inhabitants make Suet, and uſe it in ſtead of Butter.</p>
                  <p>In the Territory of <hi>Machicore</hi> many of thoſe Beaſts are found, which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times the Inhabitants ſay have been tame; and indeed they reſemble ours in <hi>Europe,</hi> onely longer Legg'd, and run through the Woods in great Herds.</p>
                  <p>There are many <hi>Kabrito's,</hi> or Rams, whoſe Females have Young common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three times a year, and four at each time. Some of the Sheep have great long Tails of five and twenty Pound weight, and nothing but clear Fat, which they boyl and eat, being excellent Food.</p>
                  <p>The Woods ſwarm with wild Hogs, which do great hurt to the Rice-Fields. The Fleſh of theſe, but chiefly of the Sows and young ones, is eſteemed a choyce Dainty. The common Hogs makes very good and wholſom Pork; for though one eats never ſo much of it, he will not ſurfet, perhaps by reaſon of their good feeding, which conſiſts moſt in Land-Turtles, and their Eggs.</p>
                  <p>There are another ſort call'd <hi>Tendrak,</hi> whoſe Fleſh, though not very pleaſing to the Pallat, yet the Inhabitants hold for a great Dainty: They ſleep ſix moneths under ground without eating, and in that time ſhed their Briſtles, and other new ones appear in their places, ſharp, like thoſe of Hedghogs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foſſe</hi> is a Creature preying upon Poultry: they eat the Fleſh thereof as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Diet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faraſſa,</hi> a devouring Beaſt, as big as a Fox, with a great long Tail, and Hair like a Woolf.</p>
                  <p>The Dogs are very ſmall, with a long Snout, ſhort Ears like a Fox, and ſuch like Hair, but of ſeveral colours.</p>
                  <p>Monkies, or <hi>Baboons,</hi> are of ſeveral ſorts; and amongſt others great ones, being white, with Spots on their Ribs and Heads, and a long Snout like a Fox;
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:56692:427"/>fierce of nature like Tygers, and make a great noyſe in the Woods. Another ſort have gray Hairs, are much ſmaller, with flat Noſes, and eaſily made tame. A third, and the moſt common, call'd <hi>Varii,</hi> are gray, and long Nos'd, with great ſhaggy Tails. Theſe may be tam'd without difficulty, if taken young, or elſe they will ſtarve themſelves to death.</p>
                  <p>There are white Apes, call'd <hi>Sifak,</hi> with yellowiſh Heads, white Tails, and two Spots on their Sides, are much bigger than the <hi>Varii,</hi> and uſually walk on their hindmoſt Legs, and keep in the Woods in great companies. There is yet another ſort of gray Apes, with Eyes ſhining like Fire, and ſhort Hair, but not poſſible to be tam'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fitſihi,</hi> or gray Squirrels, which commonly keep the Holes of hollow Trees, and not eaſily caught.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vondſira,</hi> a ſmall Vermine like a Weazle, of a darkiſh colour, greedily covets Honey, and ſmells like Musk.</p>
                  <p>There are many Civet-Cats, which the People of <hi>Manahengha</hi> and others eat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tre-tre-tre,</hi> or <hi>Tra-tra-tra,</hi> a Beaſt as large as a Cow, hath a round Head, and a Man's Face, and Feet like an Ape. <hi>Flaccourt</hi> taketh it for the <hi>Tanacht,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Ambroſe Paree:</hi> It keeps for the moſt part alone by the Pool <hi>Lepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mami.</hi> The Inhabitants ſtand ſo much in fear of it, that they flye the ſight of it, as that alſo runs away upon the appearance of a Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antamba,</hi> a great Beaſt, with a round Head: The <hi>Negro's</hi> report it as fierce and ravenous as a Leopard, and that it devours both Men and Beaſts, yet ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom appears, but keeps in the Mountains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mangerzahok,</hi> a very great Beaſt, with round Feet like a Horſe, and very long Ears, Brays like an Aſs: why may we not ſuppoſe it to be a wild one?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brehis,</hi> a Beaſt with one ſingle Horn in the Forehead, as big as a Goats, is very wild. But there are neither Tygers, Horſes, nor Lyons, as ſome have Written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Famokantratra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vermin.</note> a ſmall Beaſt, having Legs at the Tail, above the Neck, and on the outmoſt part of the Chin, ſmall Claws, with which it hangs faſt on the Barks of the Trees. It holds the Mouth always open to receive Spiders, Muggs, and other Vermin, whereon it feeds: It gain'd the Name <hi>Flamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kantratra,</hi> that is, <hi>Breaſt-hopper,</hi> becauſe it leaps upon the Breaſt of any that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach near the Tree where it ſits; and ſticks ſo cloſe and faſt, that the skin muſt be cut away with a Raſor to remove it: for which reaſon the Inhabitants much fear it.</p>
                  <p>Camelions, <hi>Valaau,</hi> Rats, <hi>Vourouzi,</hi> Mice, and other Vermine, breed here numerouſly.</p>

                     <hi>Mandouts</hi> are a ſort of Snakes as thick as a Mans Arm, but not venomous; yet much feared by the Inhabitants: It feeds upon Rats, and ſmall Birds, which they fetch out of the Waſtes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anakandef,</hi> a ſort of ſmall Snakes, which creep through the Fundament into Mens Bodies, as they ſit to eaſe themſelves upon natural occaſions, and cauſeth great pain, and in a ſhort time, death.

                  <p>Proceed we next to Serpents and other Vermine, among which we ſhall put in the firſt place Scorpions, there generally call'd <hi>Hall,</hi> of which there are divers kinds, as the <hi>Tſingalaha, Huranou,</hi> a Water-Scorpion, becauſe it keeps in Ditches and Standing-waters, kills Beaſts and Dogs by ſucking their Blood; <hi>Vankoho,</hi> or <hi>Spiders-head,</hi> having a great round and black Belly, is an exceeding dangerous Creature; for if any be ſtung by it, they fall immediately into a Swoon, remaining faint ſometimes two or three days together, and as cold as Ice. They cure it in the ſame manner as the Sting of a Scorpion, by laying the Sick before a great Fire, and giving them wholſom Medicines to diſpell the Poyſon; <hi>Anakalife,</hi> a Reptile, breeding between the Barks of rotten Trees: It is about a handful long, full of Legs, flat and thick, with a very hard Skin.

                  <p>In ſome places they tell of a wild People, by them call'd <hi>Ompizees,</hi> which let Hairs of their Heads and Beards grow very long, and go ſtark naked, onely with a few broad Leaves before their Privacies. They keep in the thickeſt Woods, and ſhun Converſe with any other <hi>Blacks,</hi> living upon Fiſh, Veniſon, Fruits, Roots, wild Honey, and Graſhoppers.</p>
                  <p>Formerly there lived on the Iſland <hi>Ontayſatrouha,</hi> lying between the <hi>Anachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſsi</hi> and the River <hi>Ranoumene,</hi> a People which held converſation with their Neighbors, but Warred againſt them continually: and not onely againſt them, but likewiſe againſt all others that travel'd through their Countrey. They cut the ſick Peoples Throats which they thought paſt recovery, and brought their Hands to the King to eat.</p>
                  <p>They feed many Cows, but neither kill them, nor Steers, Rams, Goats, nor Cocks (Cows Milk being their chiefeſt Diet) and therefore Heifers, Sheep, and Goats, they bring to ſleep upon Mats, and after their death bury them under ground. They did eat Dogs with a great appetite, when no longer fit for Boar-hunting. They till'd their Ground in the ſame manner as the other <hi>Blacks</hi> on this Iſland. Their Features are frightful and ill-favor'd, for they have ſmall Eyes, a broad Forehead, ſharp Teeth, <hi>Camoſie</hi> Noſes, thick Lips, with ſhort curl'd Hair, ruſſet Skins, without Beards, great Belly'd, and thin Legs. Theſe People did eat one another up, by which means being reduced to a ſmall number, they were all, about a hundred and twenty years ſince, deſtroy'd by their neighboring People and Enemies; ſo that now not one of them remains.</p>
                  <p>Some have reported that Giants and Dwarfs have been found on this Iſland; but occular experience hath proved that Aſſertion but a Fable. In a Tract of Land by <hi>Itapere</hi> are many Stones erected, under which the Dwarfs are ſaid to lie buried; for (ſay the Learned) they came in great numbers, and would have committed Spoil in the Countrey of <hi>Anoſsi,</hi> whence they had been driven to the River <hi>Itapere:</hi> but when for want of Boats they could not come over, they were all ſlain by the Inhabitants, and buried; who for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Victory, raiſed theſe Stones as a Monument.</p>
                  <p>No People in the world are ſo treacherous,
<note place="margin">Their Diſpoſition.</note> ſpiteful, flattering, and lying, as thoſe of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> onely towards the South-end in <hi>Mangabey</hi> they ſeem better condition'd, are leſs talkative, not ſo cruel in diſpoſition, nor ſo deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;

If it chance that any eſcape their Enemies or Proſecutors hands, ſuch is their monſtrous ingratitude, that they never return thanks, but aſcribe it to their <hi>Auli,</hi> or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and it makes them more perverſe than before. Cruelty and treachery they hold for two Capital Vertues; and thoſe accounted weak Men, and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, who pardon an offence, or uſe remiſſion and compaſſion: They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear not to exerciſe their barbarous ferocity even upon Children, whom as they meet they cut or tear in pieces, and rip up the Women with an atrocity beyond the ſalvageneſs of Bruits, taking a delight to ſee them gaſp and pant for life. Their Recreations are barbarous ſhriekings, which they term Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and antick skrewing of their Bodies in ſtead of Dancing. Man-like Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes they hate, alledging, that all things laborious bring much more diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and vexation, than delight: Theſe mock at the <hi>French</hi> when they ſee them walk, and count them Fools for wearying themſelves without a cauſe.</p>

Their chiefeſt handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work is in building of Houſes, working of Iron and Gold, Turning, making of Pots, Spinning, Weaving, Rope-making, Fiſhing, Hunting, and above all, (as already mention'd) cultivating the Ground.</p>
                  <p>The People of <hi>Ompanefavihe</hi> make of Iron and Steel, all manner of Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Bills, Hammers, Knives, Tongs, in their Countrey Language call'd <hi>Fanghali,</hi> Sciſſers, little Pinſers to pluck out the Hairs, Spits to roaſt Meat on, Forcks, all ſorts of Javelins, or Lances, Arrows, and great Butchers Knives.</p>

                  <p>The Turners and Workers in Wood make Wooden Diſhes, Cheſts, by them call'd <hi>Vaa,</hi> Wooden, and Horn-Spoons, and other Houſholdſtuff.</p>
                  <p>In Architecture, if ſo we may call it, the <hi>Zafferamini, Rohandrians, Anakandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> are eminent.</p>
                  <p>They Fiſh with Nets like thoſe us'd in Ships, Baskets in manner of Purſe-Nets,

Formerly they us'd to take Whales here, but now they have not the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to atempt it.</p>
                  <p>The Rope-makers make Cords of all ſizes and lengths; ſome of an hundred and thirty Fathom, beſides ſmaller Tackle, to tie their Baskets and Nets.</p>

                  <p>The Women Spin, and Weave many ſorts of Stuffs, of Flax or Thred, drawn from Barks of Trees, with which the Men muſt not meddle, as being an undervaluing.</p>
                  <p>Their Husbandry and method of Agriculture is perform'd with little labor; for they uſe neither Ploughs or Oxen, but meerly with a Bill cut away the great Trees, with a Cutting-Knife Prune off the Branches, and with other Implements, call'd <hi>Fangali,</hi> take away the Roots and Weeds out of the Earth, and caſt it abroad. Afterwards the wither'd Trees, Branches and Boughs, when a ſtrong Wind blows, are ſet on fire and burnt to aſhes, and therein, after it is throughly moiſtned with Rain, they Plant the <hi>Igname</hi>-Roots, Rice, and other Proviſion for Food.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding their ignorance of Arts and Sciences,
<note place="margin">Games.</note> they are poſſeſs'd with the humor of Gaming, of which two ſorts are chiefly in uſe, <hi>Andrauve</hi> and <hi>Fifangha.</hi> At the Game <hi>Andrauve</hi> they Play with little Shells, found on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, which they turn round, that at a little diſtance they may ſtrike one upon another. All the Men, as well great as ſmall, are ſo much beſotted with this Game, that ſometimes they will venture a whole Ox at one of thoſe hits. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangha</hi> is a very pleaſant Sport, but requires greater nimbleneſs of Wit and Judgment than that of <hi>Andrauve,</hi> becauſe it conſiſts moſt in ſleight of hand: two Gameſters can onely Play; the manner is with certain round Fruit, call'd <hi>Baſſy,</hi>

                  <p>In Singing they continually Dance and Leap, having a <hi>Valihan,</hi> or ſmall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Muſick in their Hands, with ſome Strings; or Playing upon a <hi>Voulle,</hi> or <hi>Bambo's</hi>-Cane with ſix Strings, or upon a <hi>Herraavou,</hi> a Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtruck with little Sticks, ſomewhat after the manner of a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimer.</p>

                  <p>The Houſes have no Chambers above,
<note place="margin">Houſes.</note> nor Cellars underneath; but meerly one Room, which they call <hi>Varerarai,</hi> with a ſmall Floor or Cieling. The Roof ſtands ſloaping, made of the Leaves call'd <hi>Rattes,</hi> and <hi>Bambo's</hi> Canes, or of Boughs. The Walls made of Planks two Inches thick. The Hearth-place at the end of the Houſe, about four Foot ſquare, heightned with Sand, upon which lie three Stones to ſet the Pot upon, but without a Chimney, ſo that the Smoke goes all over the Houſe; which makes their Abodes very unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, they likewiſe keeping continual Fires, though the heat of the Weather be never ſo exceſſive.</p>

                  <p>The next day in the Morning a <hi>Rohandrian</hi> appears bravely Clothed, with a

                  <p>This Houſe was about four Fathom broad, and eight or nine Fathom long, but ſcarce high enough for a Man to ſtand upright in, with Walls of Planks two Inches thick; it ſtood two Foot and a half from the Ground, and had ſix Doors, two before, and two behind, and on each ſide one, but all low, ſo that without ſtooping none could go in: The Roof ran up to a Point, conſiſting of Leaves call'd <hi>Rattes,</hi> which lay croſs one upon another, bound together with <hi>Mahovits,</hi> and Peeling of a certain Tree, together with <hi>Bambo's</hi> Canes, cut into little Shingles, very neatly. This manner of Roofing is very handſom, but ſubject to burning. Some cover their Houſes with green Boughs and Graſs; others with broad Leaves, call'd <hi>Raven pandre,</hi> but they are not ſo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

<note place="margin">Houſholdſtuff.</note> which they call <hi>Sihi,</hi> and are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; ſome red and yellow-colour'd, and very neatly; others common, but yet very convenient; both Braided, or made of ſeveral ſorts of Bulruſhes; with which (in ſtead of Tapiſtry) they hang the Walls of the Houſes, and ſleep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; for Bedding, Sheets, Mattreſſes, or Coverlets, are not made among them, being from their Infancy us'd to lie hard. A great many Baskets, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they lay up their Clothes, Girdles, or Belts, or <hi>Saravohits,</hi> Cotton-Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and all Ornaments which they have. Little Earthen Cruiſes for their Oyl, wherewith they anoint their Hair and Bodies. Kitchin-Veſſels, as Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Pots, call'd <hi>Villangues, Louvies, Faffes, Monhonges,</hi> and <hi>Sines;</hi> Wooden Diſhes and Spoons, Pitchers to fetch Water in, Knives call'd <hi>Antſi,</hi> great and ſmall, both ſorts made very neatly, according to the Mode of the Place; ſmall Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to pull Thorns out of their Feet, and to pull off the Hair; great Slaughter-Knives, to cut Cattels Throats, Iron Forks to pull the Meat out of the Pots, Roaſters, or Gridirons, of three Irons, or Ribs, call'd <hi>Zalaza;</hi> and a Mortar to ſtamp Rice in, with a Wooden Baſon to Fan it in. Cruiſes, or Pots, of above a hundred Quarts, wherein they make Meath of Honey. But they uſe no Table-Linnen, Towels, Earthen or Pewter Trenchers, nor Tables or Stools; but the Earth, ſpread over with a Mat, ſerves them both for Table and Stools; and great Leaves call'd <hi>Rattes,</hi> of twelve Foot long, and four broad, for Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Table-clothes: of theſe Leaves alſo Spons and Drinking-Cups are made, and Roofs for their Houſes, when they are dry.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>Their Clothes are of ſeveral colours and names; ſome all of red Silk call'd <hi>Sohatsmifili;</hi> others of Cotton ſtyl'd <hi>Varo;</hi> a third of red and mingled-colour'd Silk, Woven with pure Cotton underneath, and ſtrip'd with white; others of Peelings of the Bark of <hi>Fantatſtanou, Try, Mouffia, Avo, Courave,</hi> and the Thred of the <hi>Bananos</hi>-Tree. The beſt and fineſt are Cotton-Clothes of <hi>Anoſsi,</hi> made by the <hi>Zafferamini,</hi> and much bought up. Them which are chiefly deſired, have the breadth of twelve Inches, below border'd with Silk, the Ground of it white, with black Stripes; and ſome of black Woven Cotton and red Silk: and the great <hi>Rohandrians</hi> themſelves may onely wear that, and onely in great Solemnities: They provide it alſo to Livery their Grandees in.</p>
                  <p>The Clothes of the Bark of <hi>Fantatſtanou,</hi> are made near <hi>Manatengha, Manghafia, Soudrevingha,</hi> and <hi>Anoſsi,</hi> in this order: The Bark of the Tree, growing at the Water ſide, they firſt draw to Thred, and afterwards boyl in a ſtrong Lye: the ſcowr'd Threds are afterwards twiſted together, and by means of a Spindle, ſpun together, and at laſt Woven into Cloth. This Cloth ſo imitates ours of Hemp or Flax, that ſuch as had never ſeen it, would have taken it for the ſame. It wears ſtrong, and endures three times as long as Cotton. Of this Bark alſo they make Sail-Clothes, or Cordage.</p>
                  <p>The Clothes of the Bark <hi>Try</hi> are made of the <hi>Sazles</hi> of Thred, of a certain Shrub that affords Milk, and groweth much in the Territory of <hi>Ampatre,</hi> wears very ſoft, but not ſo ſtrong as the Cotton. The Clothes call'd <hi>Afouche</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the Countrey of <hi>Matatane,</hi> made of the Bark of the Plant <hi>Avo;</hi> of which alſo they make Paper, ſoft and gentle, but not ſtrong. <hi>Moufia</hi> Clothes are wrought in <hi>Galemboullou, Manghabei,</hi> and the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Antongil,</hi> of the Peelings of tender Leaves, which ſhoot from the Tree <hi>Moufia,</hi> the overgrown being
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:56692:431"/>great ſtalky Leaves, twelve or fifteen Foot long. <hi>Bananos</hi> Clothes are very light, and as fine as Silk Clothes. All theſe are Woven in the ſame manner as our Linnen.</p>
                  <p>The Ornaments,
<note place="margin">Ornaments.</note> or <hi>Firavach,</hi> with which theſe Iſlanders dreſs themſelves, conſiſt eſpecially in Chains, which they wear on their Necks, Arms and Legs; Gold Ear-rings, Bracelets or Rings, and other ſmall Trifles, <hi>Saraves,</hi> of Chains of Glaſs-Beads, fine Pearls, Corral, Pipes of Gold, Beads of red Cryſtal, Agats, Cornelions, Sardonyx, two or four double hang'd about the Neck. <hi>Salintes</hi> conſiſt of pieces of Corral, Agats, and red Cryſtal. <hi>Endach</hi> are made of all ſorts of colour'd ſmall round Glaſs-Beads, and four, ſix, eight, or twelve Strings worn at once. The <hi>Zafferamini,</hi> or <hi>Whites,</hi> of <hi>Matatane,</hi> have their Ears bor'd through, wherein they wear Gold Ear-rings, which are of two ſorts, one of clean and Maſſie Gold, which they call <hi>Foamitoulie;</hi> the other onely an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Snall-ſhell, cover'd over with Leaf-gold, and curiouſly wrought: for Goldſmiths there have no <hi>Borax,</hi> yet they know with ſmall red Beans (in their Countrey Language call'd <hi>Voamene,</hi> and in the <hi>Indian, Condure</hi>) how to Solder ſmall Grains of Gold together very handſomly and artificially. They have the Gilded Shells made into Necklaces, by them denominated <hi>Verenhere.</hi> Alſo <hi>Menilies</hi> of Gold, Silver, and Braſs on their Arms, and Gold, Silver, and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Rings on their Fingers; beſides <hi>Matahets an Poutan</hi> on their Thighs, Arms, and Legs, of the ſame Stuff with their Neck-chains.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Zafferamini,</hi> and chiefeſt <hi>Anakandrians,</hi> may wear the beforemention'd Ornaments; but the <hi>Blacks</hi> not, except the <hi>Voadziri,</hi> and <hi>Lohavohits,</hi> to whom and their Wives and Children it is permitted to wear Gold Ear-rings, and ſome pieces of Gold, but Pendants onely of Silver or Copper.</p>
                  <p>Every one may have as many Wives as he can keep,
<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> whom they intitle <hi>Manpirate,</hi> that is, <hi>Make-bates:</hi> for the Women of one Man alone, hate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as deadly Enemies, and call one another by the Name of <hi>Mirafe,</hi> that is, <hi>Envy,</hi> without taking exceptions at it.</p>
                  <p>The Women are no leſs addicted to Venereal Sportings than the Men, and they let no opportunity paſs to accompliſh thoſe Deſigns, having always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Husband one or two Gallants, with whom to take their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Unmarry'd Girls give their Viginity to the firſt that come to them, if they give them Money; but if they fail of Payment, they deride and diſgrace them, by taking away their Garment, which they cannot regain but by recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. But Slaves who have no Money, ſpend their wanton Luſts with Beaſts, without being puniſhed or reproved for it.</p>
                  <p>Whoredom between unmarry'd Perſons they account no ſin againſt God or Man; yea, no Girl will promiſe her ſelf to a Suitor, whom ſhe hath not had the proof of often, and a long time before: And Marry'd people themſelves think the bonds of Wedlock a wrong to them.</p>
                  <p>Young Youths and Girls uſe their pleaſure together in the preſence of their Parents, who are not onely pleaſed therewith, but provoke them to it.</p>
                  <p>Yet among all this common and beaſtial licentiouſneſs, they account it a great ſhame for their Daughter or Wives, to be too much addicted to wanton unchaſtity, to hear them prate of it, or to divulge any evil Prank they have done: Moreover they think it redounds to their diſhonour, that any ſhould ask them how many Wives they have, or whether they be fair or ill-favor'd.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>Their manner of Burials hath great Ceremonies:
<note place="margin">The manner of their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</note> for the next of Kin to the Deceaſed waſh the Corps very clean, and adorn it with Gold Bracelets, Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and Chains, deckt with Beads and other Gayeties, and ſo bury in two or three of his fineſt Garments; but carry it wound up in a great Mat to the Grave. Perſons of Quality have their Hair ſhaven off, and Women have a Quoif put on: but before that is done, all the Acquaintance, Friends, and Slaves of the Deceaſed come into the Houſe of the Dead, lamenting round about the Corps, at whoſe Feet a Candle ſtands burning night and day. In the mean while the Drummers beat upon the Drums, and many Women and Maids Dance to the ſound thereof a ſober Dance; which done, they go to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Funeral-houſe, and ſo fall to Dancing again, the Men by turns exerciſing themſelves with their Weapons. Thoſe that lament in the Houſe of Mourning, exalt the Praiſe of the Deceaſed, declaring how much ſorrow his departure brings, and ſpeak of him as ſtill alive: Laſtly, having bewail'd the Corps till the Evening, Oxen are ſlain, and the Fleſh when boyl'd or roaſted, diſtributed among the Aſſembly. The next day in the Morning the Corps is laid into a ſtrong Cheſt, made of two pieces of the Stock of a Tree hollow'd, cloſe joyn'd, and therein carry'd to the Church-yard, by them call'd <hi>Amounouque,</hi> where they ſet it in an artificial Vault, ſix Foot under ground, with a Basket of Rice, a Box of Tobacco, Earthen Diſhes, ſome Comfects, Perfumes to burn, Clothes, and a Girdle; then being ſhut up, and a great Stone, twelve or fifteen Foot high, ſet before it, many Beaſts are ſacrificed, of which they leave one part for the Dead, one for the Devil, and one for God: The acquaintance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eight or fifteen days ſend by the Slaves Food to the Dead, and cauſe him to be ſaluted as if alive. They ſet up alſo round about the Grave upon Stakes, the Heads of the ſacrificed Beaſts, and the Children come thither from time to
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:56692:432"/>time to ſacrifice an Ox, and to ask counſel of the Dead about that they mean to undertake, with theſe words: <hi>Thou who now art with God, give us Counſel in this, or the other Matter,</hi> which they then name. If they be ſick, or afflicted with diſtemper of Mind, then preſently the next Friends to the Sick ſend an <hi>Ombyaſſe,</hi> or Prieſt, to ſeek the Spirit in the Church-yard, who goes thither in the Night, and makes a hole in the Vault where the Corps lie, and calls the Soul of the Father of the Sick, asking it, <hi>Whether the Spirit hath nothing more for his Son or Daughter.</hi> Furthermore, he holds a Cap over the hole, and preſently ſhuts the Cap cloſe to it, and runs point-blank to the Houſe of the ſick Perſon, who is ſottiſh enough to ſay, <hi>That he feels himſelf well, and hath gotten his Spirit again which he had loſt in his Sickneſs,</hi> appointing a Preſent to be given to the <hi>Ombyaſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When any Perſon of Eminency happens to die far from his Countrey, then they cut his Head off, to bring it to his native Soyl, but bury the Carcaſe where he died. If he be ſlain in the Wars, they bury him in that place where kill'd, but upon the ſetling of Peace dig him up again, and lay him in the Vault with his Anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>The ſolemneſt and higheſt Oath which they take,
<note place="margin">Oath.</note> is by the Souls of their Anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>Among all the Inhumanities of theſe ſalvage People,
<note place="margin">An abominable deed in forſaking their Children.</note> the moſt horrible and abominable is, that the People of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> do cruelly caſt away their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſo that Men have no cauſe at all to wonder, why this Iſland, ſo large and fertile, falls ſhort in the account of populoſity, becauſe from the Birth thoſe Innocents are condemn'd to loſe the light of the Day, before they have ſcarce ſeen it, ſuffering it to periſh by the ſottiſh and damnable advice of their <hi>Ombyaſſes,</hi> or Prieſts, who counſel the Fathers to leave their Children, and cauſe them by a Slave to be carry'd far from the Town, and under ſome Hedge, or in the Woods, to be expos'd to the mercy of Wind and Weather, Dogs, wild Bears, and other devouring Beaſts, where at laſt with much cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lamenting, they famiſh for Hunger and Thirſt, or are cruelly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe why they do thus deſtroy their new-born Children is, that they believe them born in an unlucky Day, Moneth, or Hour, and the rather, when the <hi>Ombyaſſe</hi> ſees, that the Configuration of the Childs Planets do not ſerve his purpoſe, then ſays that the Child will be a Murtherer of his Father and Mother, and his Life unfortunate, and inclin'd to do all manner of evil, and therefore muſt be made away.</p>
                  <p>The unfortunate Moneths are eſpecially <hi>April,</hi> which they call <hi>Saffard,</hi> and the Faſting Moneth, <hi>Rama-hara;</hi> but in every Moneth the eighth Day, nam'd <hi>Aſſaronton,</hi> and the laſt Quarter of the Moon, call'd <hi>Alcacoſſy. Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays</hi> in every Week are ill Days, and the Hours which are govern'd by an evil <hi>Vitang,</hi> or Planet; ſo that theſe People account almoſt half the Year un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky. Nevertheleſs, ſome among them have a little more pity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards their Children, and after they have ſo barbarouſly expos'd them, let their Slaves (their Maid-Servants) go inſtantly, and take it thenceand Suckle it: however, they account it no more theirs, but appropriate to the Perſon that takes it up, or the Nurſe. Others are ſatisfi'd by performing <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> for their Children, that is, they ſacrifice Beaſts and Hens, and ſhut them half a day (as they ſay) to prevent the malign influence of the Conſtellation that reigns over them: for if they ſhould let them live, and not perform this,
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:56692:432"/>Ceremony, they would another day be Robbers and Murtherers of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and adicted to all Miſchief.</p>
                  <p>If a poor unmarried Woman-Slave have a Child, and her Maſter hath put her away, ſhe will not ſtick to drown the Child in the River, or bury it alive in the Ground, or otherwiſe kill it, to rid her of the burthen, trouble, and care of bringing up. If a Woman, when ſhe is great with Child, and is very ſick, or has hard Labor, they impute the fault to the Child, and the Woman orders them to kill, or to bury it alive.</p>
                  <p>If the Daughter of a <hi>Rohandrian</hi> hath had to do with a <hi>Negro</hi> before ſhe be Married (as they all do, none excepted) ſhe either cauſes an Abortion, or, if ſhe be deliver'd, makes away the Child.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, there are ſome, though few, that do it not, but cauſe the Child to be carried afar off, and nurſed by her own <hi>Negreſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If a Woman die in Labor, they bury the Child alive with the Mother, ſaying, <hi>That it is better it ſhould die than live, having no Mother left to bring it up.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Their uſual Food is Rice, Beans, <hi>Voanzonrouk,</hi> or little Wheat,
<note place="margin">Food.</note> call'd alſo <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enzou,</hi> or <hi>Mimes,</hi> and <hi>Voamitſa-Ofekque; Ignames</hi> of ſeveral ſorts; Coleworts, which they call <hi>Sanzes,</hi> and <hi>Varuattes;</hi> Oxen, Sheep, Goats, Hens, Capons, Turkeys, by them ſtyl'd <hi>Alcanga;</hi> Ducks, Pigs; but never any grown Hogs, except they Hunt them, and then they and their whole Family eat them: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of Sea and River Fiſh; <hi>Menachil,</hi> or Oyl of <hi>Seſamos,</hi> and Oyl of <hi>Ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naa:</hi> Several Fruits, as <hi>Vontaka, Lamontes, Voarats, Voanattes, Lotfes, Sakol,</hi> the Fruit <hi>Sakre, Co,</hi> Sugar-Canes, and <hi>Bananoes.</hi> They live alſo, in time of Scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Famine, upon certain Roots which grow in the Water, and in the Woods; as Roots of <hi>Ouirandre, Oumenpaſſo,</hi> and <hi>Ouuirouzes.</hi> For Sauce to their Meat, they uſually have Ginger, Garlick-Leaves, and White Pepper, though at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they look'd upon it as Poyſon. Their uſual Drink is warm Water, or the Broath wherein they boyl their Meat. They make Wine of Honey; yet they drink it not, but in their <hi>Miſſavatſi,</hi> and chief Solemnities.</p>
                  <p>They ſpeak but one Language through the whole Iſland;
<note place="margin">Language.</note> but very different in the Tone and Pronunciation; ſome giving them a ſhort, and ſome a long Accent.</p>
                  <p>This Language hath much affinity with the Eaſtern, eſpecially the <hi>Arabick;</hi> and great agreement with the <hi>Greek,</hi> as well in the manner of Expreſſion, as in the connexing of Names and Compound-words. Every thing is call'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Action, or manner of Operation by which it is effected: as, a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Tree, or Stick, they call <hi>Hazonfaulac;</hi> a torn Cloth, <hi>Sichinrota;</hi> a broken Pot, <hi>Vilanghavakqui;</hi> broken Thred, <hi>Foulomaitou;</hi> and ſo many other things: which expreſſeth the copiouſneſs of the Tongue.</p>
                  <p>In the manner of their ſpeaking, there happens a change of ſome Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:56692:433"/>Letters. The <hi>V</hi> is chang'd into a <hi>B,</hi> when the anticedent Word ends in a Conſonant; as for Exampie, <hi>Vohits</hi> ſignifies <hi>A Mountain;</hi> but to ſay <hi>Ambohits,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>In the Mountain,</hi> the <hi>V</hi> muſt be chang'd into <hi>B:</hi> The Letter <hi>F</hi> they turn into <hi>P,</hi> thus: <hi>Faſſo</hi> ſignifies <hi>Sand,</hi> or the <hi>Shore;</hi> but when the Word <hi>An</hi> comes before it, they muſt ſay <hi>Anpaſſo,</hi> that is, <hi>In,</hi> or <hi>on the Sand,</hi> or <hi>Shore;</hi> as alſo in many others: The Lords Prayer is thus; <hi>Amproy Antſica izau hanoutang andanghitſi, angharanau hofiſſahots, Vahouachanau hoavi aminay, fiteiannau boefaizangh an tane toua andanghitſi; Mahoumehanau anrou aniou abinaihane antſica, aman hanau Mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bafaca, hanay ota antſica; Tona-Zahai Manghafaca hota anreo Mououany, amanhanau aca Mahatet Seanay abin fiuet ſeuetſe ratſi, fehe hanau Metezaha hanay tabin haratſian abi, Amin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Letters which the <hi>Ombiaſſes</hi> or Prieſts make uſe of, are the ſame with the <hi>Arabick,</hi> and eight and twenty in number, written from the right hand to the left; though the Pronunciation of ſome of them differ from thoſe of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick.</hi> Theſe Letters, about two hundred years ago, were brought in among them by certain <hi>Arabians,</hi> who were ſent into this Iſland by the <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Mecha,</hi> and Landed in <hi>Matatane,</hi> where they Married the Native Women, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted every one that would in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, and <hi>Alchoran,</hi> as they do at this day.</p>
                  <p>The Paper they write upon is yellow, and made of the middlemoſt Bark of the Tree <hi>Avo,</hi> almoſt in the ſame manner like that of <hi>Europe,</hi> but with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and preparation;
<note place="margin">Paper made.</note> that is, They boyl the Bark two days in a great Kettle, with very ſtrong Lye of the Aſhes of the Tree; afterwards, being tender and ſupple, they waſh it in clear Water, and then in a Wooden Mortar beat it to Pap, which they lay together upon a Sieve, or Canvas, made of ſmall thin Reeds put together, to drain; and afterwards upon a Leaf of <hi>Baliſier,</hi> anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Oyl of <hi>Menachil,</hi> and laid to dry in the Sun: As ſoon as it is dry, they draw it through a thick Decoction of Rice, to prevent ſinking of the Ink, and then again lay it to dry, preſſing it flat and even.</p>
                  <p>Their Ink is made of the Decoction of the Wood <hi>Arandrantes</hi> (of which the Grandees build their Houſes) and the Gum <hi>Carabe</hi> comes from it,
<note place="margin">Ink made.</note> which they let ſtand till the thinner and more ſubtle parts exhaled, it becomes thick again. This Ink proves very good and durable, though not ſo black as ours in <hi>Europe;</hi> but the addition of a little Copperas makes it a pure Black. It hath no need of Gum, the Wood of which being boyl'd hath enough of it ſelf; and if it chance to be dry'd, they boyl it up with a little Water, and it becomes as good as at firſt.</p>
                  <p>Their Writing-Pens are made of <hi>Bamboes</hi> Reeds,
<note place="margin">Writing-Pens.</note> which they call <hi>Voulou;</hi> of which, cutting off a Piece the length of ones Hand, they ſhape a Pen as we do, fit and convenient to write with.</p>
                  <p>The Natives of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> number or reckon like the <hi>Europeans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Atithmetick.</note> from one to Ten; and to Ten they add One, Two, and ſo the following Numbers to Twenty, in this manner: <hi>Iſſa,</hi> or <hi>Irache,</hi> is One; <hi>Roe,</hi> Two; <hi>Telon,</hi> Three; <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fats,</hi> Four; <hi>Luui,</hi> Five; <hi>Enem,</hi> Six; <hi>Fiton,</hi> Seven; <hi>Valou,</hi> Eight; <hi>Siui,</hi> Nine; <hi>Foulo,</hi> Ten; <hi>Irach-foulo-ambi,</hi> or <hi>Iraiche amainifoulo,</hi> Eleven; <hi>Roe foulo pambi,</hi> Twelve; <hi>Roepoulo,</hi> Twenty; <hi>Telou ambi,</hi> Thirty; <hi>Effats poulo,</hi> Forty; <hi>Zatou,</hi> An hundred; <hi>Armou,</hi> A thouſand; <hi>Alen,</hi> An hundred thouſand. Indeed the <hi>Blacks</hi> of the Mountains, or on that ſide of the Countrey of <hi>Machicore,</hi> where nothing is Planted nor Sow'n, know not how to keep any Account.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>Their Meaſures are ſeveral; <hi>viz.</hi> Rice-meaſure,

                  <p>The Meaſure for Clothing, Cords, and other things to be eſtimated by Length, they name <hi>Refe,</hi> and contains a Fathom; but Ells, Feet, or Inches they have no knowledge of.</p>
                  <p>They ſet forth Lands, not by Rods, Perches, and Acres; but by the quantity of Rice that may be Sow'n upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Trade of theſe Iſlanders one among another conſiſts in exchanging Wares for Wares; for Money,
<note place="margin">Merchandiſe.</note> or Coyn of Gold and Silver, they have none; and if they get any of Foreign People, they melt it, and make thereof Bracelets and Armlets: But eſpecially they uſe Glaſs Beads, and other Commodities which the <hi>French</hi> bring to them, in ſtead of Money, to buy Oxen, Cotton, Silk Clothes, Iron <hi>Aſſagays,</hi> or Lances, Bills, Knives, and other Neceſſaries. Thoſe that have need of Cotton, bring to the Places where it is to be had, Rice, or Beaſts; and they that have need of Beaſts, or of Rice, come with Cotton to the Places where Rice and Beaſts are plenty, to barter one for the other. They exchange alſo Gold and Silver, for Copper and Iron: But this onely among themſelves; for with Foreigners they neither do, nor care to deal: So that hitherto in that Countrey there hath little Merchandiſe of conſequence been diſcover'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there grows indubitably Sapphyres, Rubies, Smaragdines, Cornelians, and other Precious Stones, as appears by the Trials which the <hi>French</hi> have made of them, and ſent into <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt deſired Merchandiſes, and by the Iſlanders beſt liked, are red Beads of all Sorts, Sizes, and Colours, pierc'd with Holes, that they may be ſtrung

                  <p>No Eminent Perſon upon the whole Iſland is without ſome Gold of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, which no way aſſimilates our <hi>European</hi> Gold, but is much paler, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon melted as Lead; they dig it out of the Ground in ſeveral Places. They have ſome Gold in <hi>Manghabei;</hi> but it lieth buried in their Church-yards, and they dare not bring it to light from thence, alledging, They are unworthy of it.</p>
                  <p>Moſt eſteem the reddeſt Silver higher than the fineſt; but the People of <hi>Anoſsi</hi> can well tell how to diſtinguiſh it: yet their Goldſmiths would not know how to work <hi>European</hi> Gold, becauſe they ſay it is too difficult to melt.

                  <p>In Military Affairs theſe People know nothing;
<note place="margin">The manner of their Wars.</note> but in ſuch Caſes, by ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Attempts coming upon their Enemies unawares, and by ſurpriſe; aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling privately, and marching by ſecret and unfrequented ways in the Woods. When they come to the Enemies Quarters, they make their Aſſault with a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous and horrible Cry; and being enter'd, kill all that come next to hand, not ſparing Infants at their Mothers Breaſts; exerciſing this Cruelty with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to extirpate the whole Generation of their Enemies, for fear that the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, ſooner or later, if they left them alive, might take Revenge.</p>
                  <p>They often ſend Spies into their Enemies Quarters, to know his Condition, and where the chiefeſt Town is, and moſt Cattel; and therefore at ſuch time they all drive them into the Mountain, to which acceſs is difficult. They ſend out ſometimes Parties, twenty, thirty, or forty of a Company, to plunder ſmall Villages, and lay the ſubdu'd Towns in Aſhes: Theſe Parties they ſtyle <hi>Tafichemanthy,</hi> that is, <hi>A ſecret Army.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe come uſually provided with <hi>Auli</hi> and <hi>Mouſſanes,</hi> that is, with Sorcery, and written <hi>Arabick</hi> Letters, with firm belief, That theſe Letters will do their Enemies much annoyance, <hi>viz.</hi> take away their courage, cauſe them to die by Sickneſs, and at leaſt be the chiefeſt cauſe of their deſtruction; whereas, to them, on the other ſide, it gives Courage, and brings all Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>Their Arms are various,
<note place="margin">Arms.</note> according to the ſeveral Countreys. In the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Androbeizaha,</hi> they uſe a great <hi>Aſſagay,</hi> arm'd at the end with a broad and long ſharp Iron Head, and carry beſides ten or fifteen <hi>Fiteracks,</hi> or ſmall Caſting-Darts, as alſo a great Javelin, call'd <hi>Renelefo,</hi> that is, <hi>The Mother of Aſſagays.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="703" facs="tcp:56692:434"/>
                  <p>In <hi>Manghafia</hi> they uſe a round Shield, and great <hi>Canbahi,</hi> or Javelin: So do they alſo in <hi>Ampatre, Mahafalle, Machicore,</hi> and <hi>Andribeizaha;</hi> but the Countreys of <hi>Anachimouſsi, Eringdranea,</hi> and <hi>Vohits-anghombe,</hi> afford the beſt-arm'd and moſt undaunted Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>On that ſide of the River <hi>Mananghourou,</hi> three Miles below <hi>Galemboulou,</hi> are a Generation of about four or five hundred ſtrong, very undaunted, which fight with Bowes, Arrows, and Darts. Thoſe of <hi>Manghafia,</hi> up Northwards to the end of the Iſland, fight Foot to Foot, onely with an <hi>Aſſagay,</hi> under ſhelter of a round Shield. Thoſe of <hi>Manamboulle,</hi> the moſt Warlike and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted of all, fight both at a diſtance, and at hand.</p>
                  <p>In Battel they keep no Order, Ranks, or File, but Fight in Crowds, every one reſolving to do ſome Execution. When any fall down wounded, they ſet up their Throats with a horrible cry; and no Slave, how mean ſoever he be, but ſticks his <hi>Aſſagay</hi> in the Body of the languiſhing Perſon.</p>
                  <p>While the Men ſtay in the Wars, the Women ceaſe not night and day to Dance, and neither ſleep nor eat in their Huts; nor, be they never ſo addicted to Venereal ſports, will they at that time have to do with any other Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving if they ſhould, their Husbands would either be ſlain or wounded in the War.</p>
                  <p>When any great Man finds his Power too weak to follow the War any longer, he ſends one to the Enemy with ſome Preſents to deſire Peace, and to appoint a Day for a Treaty, upon the concluding whereof, they meet one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other on the Shore of a River, each with all his People and Soldiers, ſtanding as ready for a Battel; where each of them kill a Heifer, and reciprocally ſend a piece of Silver to eat, making deep Aſſeverations, and high Oaths, that if they purpoſe any longer to continue the Wars, to rob one another of their Cattel, or make uſe of Sorcery or Poyſoning to damnifie each others Countrey, then that the Silver given each of them at preſent may cauſe them to burſt; that God may withdraw his hand from them; that they may be brought to deſtruction by their Enemies, and their Generations and Poſterity come to an end. But if one of them be overcome, ſo that he can no longer maintain the War, then he muſt ſubmit, and after ſending one of his People for ſafe Conduct, go himſelf in Perſon thither; and then the Vanquiſher gives the Vanquiſhed the Liver to eat, for a Confirmation that he will remain faithful to him: Whereas yet oftentimes theſe Oathes are very ſleightly accounted, the better afterwards to betray one another; wherefore they alſo, notwithſtanding their Oath, ſtand upon their Guard.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Religion both of <hi>Whites</hi> and <hi>Blacks</hi> conſiſts onely in Superſtition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of Churches or Prayers; yet they obſerve Circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>They know and believe indeed, That there is a God, who hath made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and all Creatures, and innumerable Angels; but reverence or worſhip him not: They live according to the Law of Nature, without fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; but make indeed Confeſſion of their Sins, eſpecially decripit old Men, upon their Death-Beds. They believe alſo, That there is a Devil, whom they greatly fear, and call <hi>Taiwaddey:</hi> That God is all Good, and doth no Evil: That he gives Life to Men, and all Creatures, and bereaves them of it again at his pleaſure: That the Devil is the Author of all Evil and Miſchief: That he ſends all Sickneſſes and Miſhaps into the World; cauſeth all Quarrels, Thefts, and Murthers; and is the Original of Evil: Therefore they Sacrifice unto him, to appeaſe him; they pray firſt to him, and name the Devil, before God: But they Pray alſo to a Third Power, under the Name of <hi>Dian Manang,</hi> that is, <hi>God, or Lord of Riches,</hi> which they acknowledge to be <hi>Gold;</hi> which when they ſee, or have in their Hand, with great Devotion they hold over their Heads, and kiſs it. They believe there are innumerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Miniſters of God, which do move the Heavens, the Starry Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Planets; and govern the Air, Rain, Wind, Water, and Earth; guard Mens Lives and Habitations, and defend them from all Miſchances in all their Enterpriſes, either on Water or Land, and in their Houſes.</p>
                  <p>They make the Spirits or Devils,
<note place="margin">Spirits are ſeven-fold.</note> as well good as bad, Seven-fold: The firſt are the foremention'd Angels, call'd in their Language <hi>Malainghka,</hi> which are good Angels, and never do any Evil; every one with them is known by a particular Name, as <hi>Ramichail, Ragi-bourail, Ranail, Rafil, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Michael, Gabriel, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spirits of the ſecond Order, call'd <hi>Coucoulampou,</hi> they ſay are beneath the Hoſt of Angels, and inviſible to Men; but nevertheleſs, Corporeal; That they dwell in ſolitary places, and make themſelves known to all thoſe to whom they would ſhew any particular Friendſhip; That there are Male and Female among them, and they marry one among another, beget Children, die after a long time, and as Men, expect after this Life Salvation or Damnation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they have lived well or ill; That they eat without diſtinction all ſorts of Animate or Inanimate Creatures, without ſuſpicion of any of them being hurtful to their Bodily Wellfare; That they are ſubject to no Sickneſs, as void for the moſt part of any Accidents; yet they die, and their Lives are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd within certain Limits of Time.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Rank or Order of Angels are call'd <hi>Angats,</hi> which ſignifies
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:56692:436"/>a kind of Separation, or indeed the ſame with our Ghoſts.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth are call'd <hi>Saccara,</hi> and no other than the Devils or Evil-Spirits, which uſe to Poſſeſs and afflict Men, Women, and Children: They ſee them come like Fiery-Dragons, which Poſſeſs them eight, nay, fifteen days; when they are Poſſeſs'd by them, they give them an <hi>Aſſagay</hi> or Lance in their hands, with which they continually go about Singing and Dancing, with ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions of their bodies. Men and Women of the Town flock round about the Poſſeſs'd Man or Woman, who alſo Dance and imitate thoſe Poſtures by the beat of the Drum.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh ſort of Spirits are call'd <hi>Biles,</hi> being, as they ſay, an infinite number, but all under a Supream, who is the broacher of all evil; ſo that he ſeems to be <hi>Lucifer,</hi> or the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They believe, That God after the Creation of Heaven, Earth, and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Created <hi>Adam</hi> of Earth, and plac'd him in Paradiſe, which they imagine to be in the Moon, or in the Sun; and after his ſetling there, forbade him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eat or drink, becauſe he had no need to do ſo; though they ſay there were four Rivers, one of Milk, one of Wine, one of Honey, and one of Oil; beſides all ſorts of Fruits in abundance. But the Devil (thus they relate the manner of the Fall) with ſubtilty and treachery, went to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Why eat ye not of all theſe good Fruits? Why do you not drink of that good Wine, and Milk, and taſte this delicious Honey and Oil?</hi> Whereupon <hi>Adam</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>That God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden him, which he durſt not diſobey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Devil thus driven away, ſtaid about two hours; then came again to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſaid to him, <hi>That he came from God, to give him leave to eat of all that he had a mind to. Adam</hi> thus tempted to taſte thereof, eat, and ſatisfi'd himſelf to the full; but after the digeſtion of the Food, he had a provocation and deſire to eaſe himſelf, which of neceſſity he muſt do in Paradiſe; whereupon, inſtantly the Devil went, and complain'd to God againſt <hi>Adam's</hi> bewraying of his <hi>Eden;</hi> ſo that God for that cauſe drave him out of Paradiſe, and ſent him into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where he gat a ſwelling in the Calf of his Leg, which continu'd ſix Moneths; and when the ſwelling brake, there came forth a young Maid, whereupon he ſent the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> to God, to ask what he ſhould do with that Maid; and the Angel return'd anſwer, <hi>That he ſhould bring her up, and when ſhe came to years of maturity, ſhould Marry her;</hi> which he did, and nam'd her <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouna,</hi> that is, <hi>Eve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the current of ſome time, ſhe lay In of two Sons, which being grown to a man-like ſtature, the Devil who hath a thouſand Tricks, betray'd them in this manner; He gave them an <hi>Aſſagay</hi> or Javelin in their hands, arm'd with Iron at both ends, and rais'd a quarrel betwixt them two, ſo that they both took hold of the <hi>Aſſagays,</hi> and each took one end to pull it out of the others hands; but the Irons not faſt Rivetted, by hard pulling came off, where each of them now having one, they ſtuck one another in the Belly, and both died of their Wounds. Theſe two Brothers were <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They add moreover, That <hi>Adam</hi> had many Children, which multiply'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; but becauſe Men were evil, and would no more know God, he ſent a Floud or Deluge upon the Earth; having before commanded <hi>Noah</hi> to build a great Ship, to ſave himſelf, with all his Friends and Family, Women and Children, and many Beaſts, a Male and Female of every ſort; then God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd preſently the whole face of the Earth, and all the remainder of Beaſts, except four Mountains, that is to ſay, the Mountain <hi>Zaballicaf,</hi> in the North;
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:56692:437"/>
                     <hi>Zaballicatoure,</hi> in the South; <hi>Zaballiraf,</hi> in the Weſt; and <hi>Zaballibazani,</hi> in the Eaſt: whereupon, nevertheleſs none could preſerve their lives.</p>
                  <p>After the ending of the Floud, <hi>Noah</hi> came out of his Ship, went to dwell at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and came from thence to <hi>Mecha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> (ſay they) <hi>gave four ſorts of Writings to</hi> Noah, <hi>who embraced the Law; The firſt call'd</hi> Alifurcan, <hi>or</hi> Alcaron, <hi>was for</hi> Noah: <hi>The ſecond</hi> Soratſi, <hi>for</hi> Moſes: <hi>The third</hi> Zonboura, <hi>for</hi> David: <hi>And the fourth</hi> Alindzini, <hi>for Chriſt, whom they call</hi> Rahitſa. They ſay alſo, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt was ſent by God into the world, without being begotten by any Man, but Born by the Virgin</hi> Mary; <hi>which brought him forth without pain, and remain'd a Virgin, calling her</hi> Ramariamia: <hi>That Chriſt was a Man, and God: That he was Crucifi'd by the Jews; but that God did not permit that he ſhould die, but would have the Body of a Malefactor found in his place.</hi> They obſerve the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday like the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not the Friday like the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> If they would take in hand a Journey or matter of conſequence, they take council of their <hi>Squilles,</hi> that is, of Geomancy or Black-Art, or rather of <hi>Auli,</hi> which they carry about with them in ſmall Boxes. They offer great Sacrifices of Beaſts, call'd <hi>Mitaha,</hi> at the entrance upon new Built Houſes; at the Harveſt of their Fruits of the Field; their Wives being with Child; at the luſty growing of their Plants; the Burial of their Dead, and Marriage: Faſt-Days, by them call'd <hi>Ramahana,</hi> or <hi>Miafauthe,</hi> and by the <hi>Turks, Ramedan,</hi> which they obſerve with great Ceremony, but not in any ſet Moneths, but now in one, and then in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, according to the poſition and order of the year.</p>
                  <p>They Circumciſe their Children with great Formality commonly in <hi>May,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Circumciſion.</note> when it is <hi>Fridays</hi> Year, for by the days of the Week they reckon their Years; eſpecially the People of <hi>Anoſſy</hi> and <hi>Matatane;</hi> for all the other Circumciſe at all times: To the performance whereof come all the Friends in Conſanguinity and Alliance of the Child to the Circumciſion into the Town, to which the Parents bring Wine, and preſent an Ox or Heifer for every Infant; but poor people leſs.</p>
                  <p>The Men play and exerciſe with <hi>Aſſagays</hi> or Lances, among which the Drums, whom they ſtile <hi>Ompivango,</hi> beat the <hi>Azontake</hi> or Drums, made of a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Trunk of a Tree, cover'd over with two Skins; the one of an Ox, and the other of a Goat, upon which they Tabor at one end with a Stick, and at the other with their Hand; the Female Relations Dance round about thoſe who exerciſe with <hi>Aſſagays,</hi> and uſe divers Geſtures and ſtrange Poſtures; Theſe Pranks finiſh'd, all the young Company Dance and Sing again; then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Town (who muſt celebrate the Circumciſion) beginning to drink of the Wine of Honey or Meath, follow to guzzle as much as poſſible, for they that Drunk moſt, are the greateſt honor to the Aſſembly. In the Evening, Oxen are kill'd to eat in the day, ſometimes to the number of two hundred. The next Morning (the Feaſt-day) every one remains quiet; but the Fathers and Mothers ſometime make their Children ready in the mean time, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſleep that night with their Children, in the <hi>Lapa,</hi> that is, the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place erected a Moneth before, with divers Ceremonies, by the Fathers and Uncles of the Children, to be Circumciſed. No Father may approach the Mother that night, nor know any woman; and no Woman, Maid, or Man, who have uſed incontinency, muſt dare to joyn himſelf in perſon at the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, for they are poſſeſs'd with this Superſtitious Opinion, that then the blood of the Fore-skin of the Child will not ſtench, but the Child die: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may any perſon preſent wear any red thing on his body at that time, or if they do, it muſt be very cloſe from ſight.</p>

                  <p>Early, at break of Day, Men, Women, Maids, and all others, Bathe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and beating their Drums at Sun-riſe, chop up ſome ſhort Prayers, and the Circumciſer himſelf utters aloud, <hi>Salama, Zahanhare Zahomiſſabots Anauhanau, Nambouatſitangho, amini Tombuc, Zahomitoulou bouzonhamiuau,</hi> &amp;c. Which is, <hi>Be thou Magnified, O my God; I draw near with my Prayers to thee, thou haſt Created our Hands and our Feet; I beſeech thee forgiveneſs of our Sins; I kneel down before thee; I do Circumciſe theſe Children this day,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards they bring the Children into the <hi>Lapa,</hi> adorn'd and dreſs'd with Corals and Bracelets, Pretious Stones, and other Ornaments about their Necks: Here they ſtay till the tenth hour of the Morning, with an empty body, which they can diſcern by the ſhadow of a Man in the Sun, ſtanding ſtraight upright; for they meaſure the ſhadow with their Feet, which they call <hi>Liha,</hi> or <hi>Pas,</hi> which being nine of their own Feets length, is the time of the Circumciſion. Then the Drums beat, and the Circumciſer puts on his Garments, and binds a Fillet of great ſtrong white Cotton-Yarn to his left Arm, to ſcour his Knife. At laſt, every Father takes his Child in his Arms, and going a Proceſſion through the <hi>Lapa,</hi> paſſing in at the Weſtern Door, and out again at the Eaſtern, ten by ten, one after another twice: After ſome ſhort pauſe, they begin two other for the Oxen which are for the Sacrifice; and with the left hand of the Child touch their right Horn, as they lie upon the ground, with their Feet ty'd together: Then all the people are bid to clear the place, and a large Ring made; whereupon the Circumciſer appears with his Knife, to cut off the Fore-skin of every Child, which the Uncle of the Child receives, and lays into the white and yealk of a Hens-Egg which he holds in his hand; but a <hi>Rhoandrian</hi> or <hi>Anakandrian</hi> kills the Cattel, and cuts for every Child a Hens throat, and lets the Blood drop upon every Wound; and another puts upon it the Juyce of a certain Herb call'd <hi>Hota,</hi> a kind of Clover-Leaf. If the Child be a Slave, and hath no Uncle, then the Fore-skin is thrown upon the ground; This day they keep ſo holy, that no Sport is made, nor none then drink beyond the meaſure of hillarity.</p>

                  <p>The Prieſts call'd by them <hi>Ombyaſſes,</hi> and by the <hi>Moors, Marabauts;</hi> are of two ſorts, that is, <hi>Ombiaſſes Ompanorats,</hi> and <hi>Ombyaſſes Omptifiquili;</hi> the <hi>Ompanorats</hi> are Scribes, who can write <hi>Arabick</hi> very Expertly; they have many Books, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are ſome pieces of the <hi>Alcaron:</hi> moſt of them underſtand the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue, which they teach, together with Writing.</p>
                  <p>Several Offices are conferr'd upon the <hi>Ombyaſſes, Ompanorats,</hi> which very much agree with the Church-Offices among Chriſtians; as <hi>Male, Ombyaſſe, Tibou, Mouladzi, Faquihi, Catibou, Loulamaba, Sabaha, Taliſman. Male</hi> is a Clerk, which onely teacheth to Write: <hi>Ombyaſſe,</hi> a Maſter of Arts: <hi>Tibou,</hi> an under Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con: <hi>Mouladzi,</hi> a Deacon: <hi>Faquihi,</hi> a Prieſt: <hi>Catibou,</hi> a Biſhop: <hi>Loulamaba,</hi> an Arch-Biſhop: <hi>Sabaha,</hi> a Pope.</p>
                  <p>Theſe People cure the Sick, make <hi>Hiridzi,</hi> or <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> or <hi>Maſſaſſer</hi>-Robes, which are certain Charms or Spells, written with <hi>Arabick</hi> Letters, which they ſell to the Grandees and Rich men, with promiſe that they ſhall be freed from a thouſand Miſchiefs, Sickneſſes, Thunder, Fire, Enemies, yea from Death it ſelf; though they know not how to preſerve themſelves from it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Cheaters make great gain of thoſe Letters, receiving for them Beaſts, Gold, Silver, Clothes, and all Conveniencies. The people ſtand in great fear of theſe <hi>Ombyaſſes,</hi> and hold them for Sorcerers and Witches; as alſo the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of the Countrey, make uſe of them againſt the <hi>French,</hi> but without any effect; alledging, that their Sorcery can do nothing upon them, becauſe they eat Swines-Fleſh, and are of another Religion. It chanc'd, that theſe <hi>Ombyaſſes</hi> cloſe under the Fort of the <hi>French</hi> (to drive them away) had brought Baskets full of Papers written with <hi>Arabick</hi> Letters, Eggs laid upon a Friday, fill'd over with Characters, and <hi>Arabick</hi> Writing, Earthen Pots never yet ſet upon the Fire, written upon within and without, Biers to carry the Dead, written upon, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noos,</hi> Girdles, Sciſſers, Pinſers of Iron to pluck the Hairs out; In brief, nothing was omitted that they thought expedient for the Work, yet without any other effect, than the Paſtime of the <hi>French</hi> at their ridiculous Vanity.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Ombyaſſes Ompanorats,</hi> are the uſual Phyſitians who viſit the Sick, and give them Medicines, being Decoctions of Herbs and Roots. They alſo Cure Wounds, and write Charms with <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters, which moiſten'd with Water, they hang about the Necks and Middles of the Sick, to expel all Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and evil Influences. They make likewiſe Geomantick Images, to find out the time of the Diſeaſe, and to diſcover the Remedies fit for the Malady. If the Sick recover not as they expect, they acquaint him that he wants ſomewhat, and ſo ſet upon the Work anew, either till he die, or grow well of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ombyaſſes,</hi> in the mean time, get both from the Patient and his Friends all they require, as Gold, Silver, Corral, Cows, Clothes, Girdles, and other things.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ombyaſſes Ompanorats,</hi> among the People of <hi>Matatane</hi> keep publick Schools to teach Children.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Omptifiquili</hi> are commonly <hi>Negro's</hi> and <hi>Anakandrians,</hi> which undertake the practice of Geomancy, or Soothſaying, in the Countrey Language call'd <hi>Squi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> and do ſuch like Feats, as in <hi>Europe</hi> the Books of Geomancy expreſs; onely they erect their Schemes or Work upon a Plank, ſtrew'd over with Sand, whereupon they make Figures with their finger, ſetting down the Day, Hour, Moneth, Planet, and Signs that have Dominion over the Hour, according to which they Preſage.</p>
                  <p>Strange things are attempted in this Art, yet they ſeldom hit upon the truth,
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:56692:438"/>but rather judge blindly by gueſs; nevertheleſs they are eſteem'd by all.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of <hi>Ombyaſſes</hi> among the <hi>Negro's,</hi> which the Sick alſo ſend to, yet can neither Write nor Read, but make onely Geomantick Figures, and uſe Cryſtals, Topazes, Eagle-Stones, Amethyſts, and others, which they call by the general name of <hi>Filaha;</hi> making the people believe, God ſends them theſe Stones by the Thunder, to work Cures by; which perſwaſion hath taken ſo deep root in the hearts of the Iſlanders, that they cannot be drawn to believe the contrary.</p>
                  <p>They have great gliſtering Cryſtals, but foul and cloudy, which they ſay are <hi>Terachs,</hi> that is, having others within: when they make Figures, they have one of theſe Stones in the corner of their Tables, ſaying, That it hath power to bring activity into their fingers.</p>

                  <p>In the whole there is not a foot breadth of Land but belongs to ſome Lord or other, ſo that it is an error and miſtake to ſay, that every one may make uſe of as much Land as he will.</p>
                  <p>There are not found in this whole Iſland any written Laws, but all is done according to the Law of Nature, being three-fold; <hi>Maſsindili,</hi> or the Princes Law; <hi>Maſsinpah,</hi> the natural Law of particular people, which is no other than their own way; and <hi>Maſsintane,</hi> the Law or Cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                  <p>The Princes Law, or <hi>Maſsindili</hi> is a compound word of <hi>Maſsin,</hi> that ſignifies Law or Cuſtom; and <hi>Hadili</hi> that ſignifies Command, being nothing elſe but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Will, grounded nevertheleſs upon Reaſon, conſiſting in the doing every one Right, to determine differences; ſuch as have done others wrong, to puniſh them in their Eſtates or Goods.

                  <p>It lieth to the Eaſt of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> in one and twenty degrees and a half South-Latitude; being fifteen Leagues long and ten broad, and full eight days Journey in circumference.</p>
                  <p>There is not one convenient Haven, by reaſon of the Rocks on the Shore, which makes the coming of Ships to this Iſland oftentimes dangerous; but there are ſeveral Roads, the beſt of which lieth Weſt, and North-Eaſt; the next is on the Northſide, and another on the Southſide, ſurrounded with Rocks, with an entrance ſcarce wide enough for one Ship to come in at; near which the <hi>French</hi> have built a Chappel for <hi>St. Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the Southſide of this Iſland ſtands a Mountain which continually Burns, and Vomits out Fire; as another on the Iſland <hi>Del Fuoga,</hi> one of the <hi>Cape de Verd</hi> Iſlands, and the Mountain <hi>Hekla</hi> in <hi>Yſland;</hi> from the South to the Eaſtſide lieth a Tract of Land of twenty Miles, quite burnt up by the ſultry heat of the Air; however, this Countrey doth ſeem to have been very good formerly.</p>
                  <p>The Burning begins from the South-Point, and takes its courſe aloft over the Mountains: As you travel croſs thorow the Countrey, from the South to the Weſt, you may find a ſmall Tract of Land of about ſix Miles, wherein is a Lake, whence iſſues a ſmall River, which runs through all the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The Air, though very hot, hath the repute of being healthful, as receiving frequent cooleneſs from the freſh Breezes ariſing out of the Mountains. It hath ſeveral Rivulets, Brooks, and Springs, which along the Cliffs, and

                  <p>The Rivers by the <hi>French</hi> diſcover'd on the Coaſt, and flowing into the Sea, are, the grand River <hi>Du Galet,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-River, Stone-Cliffe River,</hi> and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>St. John, St. Steven,</hi> and <hi>St. Giles:</hi> It lieth totally deſolate, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>French</hi> have ſometimes endeavor'd to have Planted it with ſome Colonies of People.</p>

During their three years continuance there, they averred, that they perceived not the leaſt ſpice of either Ague or Fever, neither had pain in the Head or Teeth, notwithſtanding they went continually naked, bare-footed, and nothing on their Heads; yea, ſome of them coming ſick thither, immediately recover'd health.</p>
                  <p>In the Year Sixteen hundred fifty four, a <hi>French</hi>-man call'd <hi>Antonis Thaureau,</hi> went with leave of the <hi>French</hi> Governor of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> with ſeven other of his own Nation, and ſix <hi>Blacks,</hi> to ſettle themſelves in this Iſland: After a Journey of twelve days arriving there, they ſeated themſelves at the ſide of a certain Lake, which mixes its Water with the Sea, at a place where a great <hi>Bay</hi> lieth, a convenient Road for ſhips, in the Weſt-North-Weſt part of the Iſland.</p>
                  <p>They took along with them from <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> five Cows, with one Calf, and one Steer, which mixed themſelves with five and thirty other very fine and fat Steers, which were come of thoſe that had been put on Shore five years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They immediately built Huts for their abode, and buſied themſelves in making of Gardens, and Planting of Tobacco, Melons, and all ſorts of Cod-Fruits: but when the Tobacco was almoſt ripe, the ſame, with their Huts, was ruin'd by a Heuricane; ſo that they were neceſſitated to Build and Plant anew. In the mean time while the Seaſon of Planting came on again, being in <hi>October, November,</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> (for their Harveſt is in <hi>April</hi>) the aforeſaid <hi>Thaureau,</hi> with ſome of the other, concluded to take a Journey round about the Iſland to diſcover the ſame exactly, and to take notice of the Countrey; but they found almoſt nothing but Plants of Aloes: after two days Journey they came to the Sea-coaſt, which runs from the Point in the North, to the other in the South, five Miles long, convenient for Habitation, and very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and pleaſant Meadows, water'd by ſeven very fine Rivers, which take their original out of a great Lake, ſurrounded with Mountains, where the Standard with the Arms of <hi>France</hi> were ſet up, by the command of <hi>Flaccourt.</hi>

                  <p>The chief City, call'd <hi>Pavoſan,</hi> or <hi>Pavaoſe,</hi> through which run two ſmall Rivers, hath its ſituation on an even place, on the North-ſide of the <hi>Bay,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more longer than round, and about half a days walking in compaſs; containing about fifteen hundred Houſes, every one ten Stories high.

                  <p>The Ground is moiſtned by ſeveral Brooks and Rivers of clear and freſh Water, to their great enriching.</p>
                  <p>On the middle of this Iſland riſes a Woody Mountain, continually cover'd with Snow, whence divers Brooks and Streams draw their originals.</p>
                  <p>The Air is very hot and untemperate, moiſt, unwholſom, inimical to the People of <hi>Europe,</hi> who ſeldom attain there to the age of fifty years, whereas the Natives, a People that have but little Blood, oftentimes arrive to above a hundred. Some affirm, that a young Man in his growth coming thither; ſhall never grow bigger, but always remain at his firſt Stature; and that a dead Corps laid in the Ground, will rot and decay in four and twenty hours.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this unwholſomneſs hath been imagin'd to proceed from the over-great Heats, and damp Fogs. Some have reported, that this malign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperature doth not ſpread over the whole, but confin'd chiefly to the City, and occaſion'd by the low ſituation thereof: for from the Rain-water which falls down abundantly from the Hills to the Valleys, are exhal'd noyſom Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, which afterwards fall down in the Evenings and Mornings, with an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive influence; whoſe fume or dewy ſtream receiv'd into the Body, corrupts and irritates the Blood: for the avoiding which direful hazards at thoſe times, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> there reſident keep within their Houſes.</p>
                  <p>But this Air loſes ſome of theſe ill qualities in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the South-eaſt and South-weſt dry and cool Winds; which blowing over from the Coaſt of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> refreſh the Countrey, and clear the Air, to the great advantage of Strangers, although the Natives receive detriment thereby.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Iſlanders, as all others under the Equinoctial, have two Winters, not in reſpect of Cold, but onely of Moiſtures, one in <hi>March,</hi> and another in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember;</hi> at which time the Sun ſhines from the Vertical Point upon the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants Heads, without making a Shadow either to the North or South; which happens twice a year at Noon.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this double Winter ſeems to proceed from the violent attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Heat, caus'd by the ſcorching beams of the Sun, which ſo fill the Air
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:56692:443"/>with watry Exhalations, that the Sun, as clouded therewith, ſhines not out, and ſo thoſe dusky Vapors diſſolve themſelves in great and continuing Rains, the onely ſign of Winter, the over-heated Air hardly chill'd thereby.</p>
                  <p>The rainy Moneths continue from <hi>December</hi> to <hi>April,</hi> when all the low Land lies under Water. Our Summer-Moneths, <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> make their Spring; and with them Summer begins when the Sun firſt enters into the beginning of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and continues till it comes to the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> that is, in <hi>December, January, February,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>March;</hi> and then the Air is very moiſt and hot, ſo that Foreigners keep themſelves in places under ground, yet oftentimes can neither eſcape great Sickneſſes or Death; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Natives being of a cold and dry Conſtitution, live in good health: yet when the heat arrives at the heighth, it makes the Inhabitants themſelves ſo faint, that they can ſcarce go, and the Ground ſo hot, that they muſt wear Shooes with double Soles and thick Corks, to ſave their Feet from ſcorching.</p>
                  <p>The Sickneſſes which proceed from the untemperate heat,
<note place="margin">Unwholſomneſs of the Air.</note> are burning and peſtilential Fevers, ſeizing Strangers in eight days time, firſt by ſhivering and coldneſs, afterwards with heat through all their Limbs, for two hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with ſuch violence, that the infected Party oftentimes on the fourth, or ſeventh, or at longeſt on the fifteenth day, dies; but if he out-live that time, he grows well again on a ſudden, and ſo may continue, except he prejudice himſelf by gluttony or drinking; for the beſt Medicine is a moderate Diet, to eat little and faſt much; beſides, to purge the Body with Juice of <hi>Caſsia Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula,</hi> and ſometimes to breath a Vein, and take away ſuperfluous Blood.</p>
                  <p>The Sickneſs call'd <hi>Bitios de Ku,</hi> ranges here alſo, being cured with Juice of Lemons, as before related.</p>
                  <p>The Pox is ſo cuſtomary to the Natives, that they make nothing of it, but ſuddenly and with great eaſe cure it, by means of Quickſilver, yet proves mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to many Strangers; who ought therefore to be very careful how they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the black Women, by reaſon of the inequality of their Conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>The Dropſie is very frequent, which they cure by applying outwardly the Oyl of <hi>Coco</hi>-Nuts, and the Juice of ſeveral Herbs, of which the <hi>Negro's</hi> have good knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Above a Century of years ſince, the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> hearing of the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Soil, ſent ſome over thither, who died through the unwholſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Air: Again he ſent others, who went firſt into <hi>Guinee,</hi> from thence to <hi>Angola,</hi> and at laſt ſetled on this Iſland, that they might as it were <hi>Pedetentim,</hi> ſtep by ſtep, be enabled to endure the evil temperature thereof.</p>
                  <p>Some have reported, that <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſold the <hi>Jews</hi> for Slaves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their refuſing to embrace the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and Baptizing their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſent them thither; from whence the Iſlanders ſeem to be extracted.</p>
                  <p>No ſmall number of ſick and dead Men had the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> on this Iſland, when in the Year Sixteen hundred forty one, under the Command of Admiral <hi>Jol,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Houtebeen,</hi> they overcame this Iſland: for there ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd twelve ſound and healthful Men in a Company; and <hi>Jol</hi> himſelf, with moſt of the other Commanders died: Nay, the Diſtemper came at laſt with ſuch wide paces amongſt them, that there ſcarce remain'd any to be upon the Watch, or ſtand Sentinells, and not Sea-men enough to Man two Ships: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſent to Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> in <hi>Braſile</hi> for Soldiers, Proviſions, and Wine for refreſhment. Moſt of them died of great pains in their Heads; ſome of the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the Guts in three or four days. The cauſes whereof might be their too
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:56692:444"/>much eating of Black Sugar, or the Milk of <hi>Coco</hi>-Nuts, which occaſions Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but indeed the principal cauſe was thoſe malignant Fogs, againſt which they had no ſhelter. This venomous Air caus'd a greater Deſtruction amongſt the People of the Admiral <hi>Peter Verdoes,</hi> coming thither with his Fleet in the Year Sixteen hundred and ten, in <hi>November;</hi> when within fourteen days there died above a thouſand, of which the Admiral himſelf, and the other Admiral <hi>Storm,</hi> together with ſeventeen Sea-Commanders, and all the Land-Officers except one. Nay, the Diſeaſe raged at length among them with ſo great fury, that the Bellies of ſome being open'd, their Cauls were turn'd to Water.</p>
                  <p>The Ground is tough,
<note place="margin">The Soil.</note> and of a yellowiſh Ruſſet Colour; and by reaſon of the many Miſts, which fall every Night, it grows ſoft, like Wax, and becomes fit to produce all ſorts of Grain, Fruits, and Plants. The goodneſs and fertility thereof appears by this; That ſo ſoon as a plain Place is left untill'd, or laid waſte, Trees grow upon it, and ſhoot up to a great height in few days, which the <hi>Blacks</hi> cut down and burn, to plant the Sugar-Canes in their Aſhes, which grow every where in the Valleys, but yield leſs Juyce than thoſe in <hi>Braſile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Canes Planted in the fore-mention'd Aſhes, muſt have five Moneths time to ripen in: For that which is Planted in <hi>January,</hi> is Cut in <hi>June;</hi> and that of <hi>February,</hi> in <hi>July:</hi> And in this manner they Cut and Plant all the Year through. The full-grown Canes, when cut, are grownd ſmall in Water-Mills, which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> call <hi>Ingenhas;</hi> or by the Labor of Slaves or Oxen, in places where there are no Rivers: Afterwards they put the Juyce into great Kettles, and boyl it over the Fire, to cleanſe it; and with the Refuſe they feed the Hogs, which eating nothing elſe, grow exceeding fat, and are eſteem'd ſuch wholeſom and ſweet Fleſh, that they Diet therewith the Sick, to recover them to their Health.</p>
                  <p>Seven Ships Lading of Sugar this Iſland ſends forth every Year; that is, Four for <hi>Portugal,</hi> two for the <hi>Canary</hi> and <hi>Madera</hi> Iſlands, and one for <hi>England:</hi> And there might be a great deal more made, and alſo whiter; but they want Pots and other Neceſſaries to cleanſe it, and alſo Refiners to work it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have ſent for many Artiſts from the <hi>Maderas,</hi> to make their Sugar whiter and harder; but could never effect the ſame, the Air making their Labor fruitleſs, becauſe it doth not ſuffer it to dry: And therefore the Sugar-makers are neceſſitated to ſet the Loaves upon low Planks inclos'd round, and to ſet them upon Boughs of thick dry Wood, which being ſet on Fire, make no Flame nor Smoak, but at length glimmer like glowing Coals, and ſo dry it, as in Stoves. Before the coming of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> there grew no Sugar-canes, nor Ginger; but they brought them thither, and planted them.</p>
                  <p>In the Year Sixteen hundred forty five, there ſtood on this Iſland four and fifty Mills, which every one had their Moneths to grind, and could make every Year twelve or fourteen Tun of Sugar. In the Year Sixteen hundred and ten, there were ſixty one Mills, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ruin'd; ſo that ever ſince they have for the moſt part been able to do nothing, for want of Coppers, and Slaves to work.</p>
                  <p>The Corn never attains to its full growth, becauſe the over-fatneſs of the Soil, and the exceeding Moiſture, hinders the due Ripeneſs. There are many Vineyards, which have all the Year Grapes, both white and red, ripe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe; alſo ſweet and ſoure Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons, Pomegranates, <hi>Coco</hi>-Nuts, Figs, Water-Melons, Peaches, Olives, Almonds, and ſuch like; but the Fruits never grow to a full perfection, becauſe theſe Plants have need of a
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:56692:444"/>cloſing and drying Coolneſs, which here they want. The want of Corn, Nature hath ſupply'd to the Inhabitants by Roots, as Potatoes, or <hi>Ignames,</hi> their uſual and chiefeſt Food, of which they have four ſorts; one call'd <hi>Benyn;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Achorere;</hi> the third, <hi>Maniconge;</hi> and the fourth <hi>Saffranee,</hi> according to the Places from whence brought to this Iſland. The two firſt are the beſt; the one for its ſweetneſs, and the other for its longeſt keeping good. The next is <hi>Mandihoka;</hi> but they eat little of it, rather ſending it to <hi>Angola.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Braſile</hi> they plant much of it; onely the Root grows nothing near ſo thick there, as in theſe places. And here you muſt obſerve, That the Juyce muſt be preſt out of the <hi>Braſilian Mandihoka,</hi> being ſo hurtful and poyſonous, that if any one ſhould chance to eat of it unpreſs'd, he would run the hazard of his Life: But on this Iſland they immediately dry it as it is Grownd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſſing, of which none get any hurt or damage by eating.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Banano's</hi> alſo, <hi>Bakovens, Kuſsu</hi>-Apples, two or three ſorts of <hi>Jojoos,</hi> or ſmall <hi>Beews,</hi> and <hi>Turky</hi>-Wheat, or <hi>Maiz,</hi> may be had there; and <hi>Peſigos,</hi> a Fruit grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Tree of the ſame name, ſomewhat hairy on the out-ſide, which muſt be cut off; and then you have a little Meat, over a ſoft Stone, yet pleaſant to the taſte, and of a cooling quality.</p>
                  <p>Another Fruit call'd <hi>Kola,</hi> of the bigneſs of a Walnut, grows on very high Trees, in a light green Shell or Cod: It conſiſts chiefly in four or five ſharp red Kernels, lying cloſe together; they taſte like a raw Cheſſnut, but ſomewhat bitteriſh; yet a draught of Water after it, makes it ſeem ſweet. They drive a good Trade herewith to <hi>Lovando St. Paulo,</hi> whither they carry it by Shipping.</p>
                  <p>Neither do they want <hi>Palmito</hi>-Trees, out of which the Inhabitants make Wine, and out of the Kernel of the Fruit extract by Decoction Palm-Oyl, which they ſend over to <hi>Angola.</hi>

<pb n="725" facs="tcp:56692:446"/>high; where after a long Fight, for want of Ladders to ſcale the Walls, they were neceſſitated to Retreat, with the loſs of many Men: But the City <hi>Pavaoſon</hi> they eaſily gain'd, being void of Citizens, Soldiers, and all moveable Goods. Afterwards the foremention'd Fort was ſurrendred by the Governor, who with eighty Garriſon-Soldiers, <hi>Blacks, Whites,</hi> and <hi>Mulatos,</hi> march'd out, and with five and twenty Soldiers of the Kings Band, were Shipp'd over to <hi>Lisbon.</hi> In the Fort came to the Victors hands ſix and thirty great Pieces of Ordnance, of which twenty were of Braſs; abundance of Powder, Match, and Bullets; but Victuals ſcarce for one Moneth. The City and Fort thus taken, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Jol</hi> cauſed the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> to be call'd into the City again, to Treat with him upon Equitable Concerns; whereupon two of the chiefeſt came and bought off the Deſtruction of the Mills, and preſervation of their Canes, for five thouſand and five hundred <hi>Cruſadoes,</hi> and ten thouſand <hi>Arohas</hi> of Sugar: But the Kings Revenue and Treaſure came to the Victors.

                  <p>Many Turtels and Fiſh are taken between the Cliffs, out of which the Slaves decoct a Train-Oil, all out of the Salt-Water, for they have no freſh. In ſhort, ſuch is the ſterility, as affords no other refreſhment but poor Goats, yearly kill'd in great numbers for their Skins.</p>
                  <p>Two Miles from the Road on the South ſide of the Countrey, is a Pond of Salt-Water nine or ten foot deep, into which a Brook runs with very clear wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but not held to be very wholſome, becauſe brakiſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>St. Jago</hi> yields all ſorts of Fruits, having indeed a very fruitful Soyl; Trees of Cedar, <hi>Colcoes,</hi> Oranges, and the like, all along beautifie the Banks of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Ribeira Korea.</hi> They have alſo Rice, <hi>Maiz, Mille,</hi> Cotton, and Sugar-Canes.

                     <hi>Ilha Brava,</hi> produces Figgs, Mulberries, and other Fruits; alſo <hi>Mille, Maiz,</hi> Water-Melons, and many others. Some Goats, but they may not be ſold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave of the Governor of <hi>St. Jago.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the Iſland <hi>St. Nicholas</hi> are but few Trees. It feeds many wild Cats and Goats; cloſe by the Shore is freſh Water in a Pond, which in time of Rain flows over the Shore into the Sea.</p>

                     <hi>St. Lucie</hi> appears Mountainous, with many Woods, and ſome freſh Water: At the Weſt ſide, hath no other Inhabitants than Mice, and Tortoiſes.</p>
                  <p>At the Watering-place of the Iſland <hi>St. Vincent,</hi> freſh Water may be had out of Wells, but not very pleaſant.

The parch'd ground bears lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle but ſtones, being every where ſo bare, that there is neither Leaves nor Graſs to be found, but onely a few Shrubby Buſhes, which Seamen pull up and fetch for Fuel; and <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> which grows in ſo great quantities, that it cannot be deſtroy'd. There are many Tortoiſes, very good in taſte, and ſo big, that the Sea-men who touch at this Iſland for freſh Water, are compell'd to hale them Aboard with Ropes. They come every night in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> out of the Sea to the Land, when the Inhabitants caſting them upon their backs, by reaſon of their weight they cannot turn themſelves again. The Countrey hath many Rocks, but little Water. The Goats they kill for their Skins, which they ſend yearly to <hi>Portugal</hi> in great quantities. Their Inhabitants are <hi>Blacks,</hi> who live there very ſoberly without Recreation; fetching their Water in Leather Sacks made of Goats Skins; in the Year Sixteen hundred twenty three, they were

                     <hi>Ilha de Mayo,</hi> a Rocky and dry Land, with little Graſs; affords onely ſome few Figg-trees, which by the heat of the Climate, and dryneſs of the Ground, never bear any ripe Fruit; for though the Figgs have a promiſing colour, yet they are inſipid or taſtleſs. But Goats, or <hi>Cabriets,</hi> or Sheep breed ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, that above five thouſand Skins are carry'd thence yearly.

                  <p>There are many Salt-Pans, which after they have let in the Salt-Water, being ſhut up, the heat of the Sun conſolidates, and brings to a Gray-Salt; but 'tis a toilſome work to gather it, and yet more troubleſome to get on Ship-board, becauſe the Boats are not without great danger of being ſwallow'd up by the Whirlpits.</p>

                  <p>The Inhabitants have neither Corn nor Clothing, unleſs brought them from <hi>St. Jago;</hi> but there are many Goats which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> and <hi>Blacks</hi> there reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent catch up with Dogs, partly for the Skins, and partly for the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>St. Anthonio</hi> has many Woods, and therein ſeveral ſorts of Fruits; as Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Lemons, Dates, Pomegranates, Sugar-Canes, <hi>Bakovens,</hi> and Melons: One Orchard lieth in this Iſland, of which nothing can be ſeen from Sea, but a high Palm-Tree, which the people of the Ships, in the Bay of <hi>St. Vincent</hi> diſcern plainly, and commonly ſend their Boats to barter Knives, and other ſuch ſmall Toys for Fruit, with the people who have a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Governor; their number generally about five hundred, moſt of them <hi>Blacks,</hi> who from another Orchard bring the Fruits upon Aſſes to the Shore ſide, to ſell to the Sea-men.

To come to the top requires three days Journey: from whence may be ſeen all the Iſlands lying about thirty <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles off in the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Here they find great quantities of Sulphur, with abundance of Fruits, Wine, and Sugar. The Inhabitants are reckon'd to be about the number of five thouſand.</p>
                  <p>In the Hiſtory of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> lately ſet forth by Dr. <hi>Thomas Sprat,</hi> we have a Relation from ſome conſiderable Merchants, and Perſons worthy of Credit, who went to the top of this <hi>Pico Teneriff,</hi> ſet down in theſe following words:</p>
                  <figure>
                     <head>
                        <hi>The pike Mountaine upon The Iſland Tenerieto.</hi> De PIEK-BERGH op het EILANT TENERIETO</head>
                  </figure>
                  <p>Of the Iſland <hi>Teneriff</hi> it ſelf, this account was given by a judicious and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Man, who lived twenty years in it, as a Phyſitian and Merchant; his opinion is, That the whole Iſland being a Soil mightily impregnated with Brimſtone, did in former times take Fire, and blow up all, or near all at the ſame time; and that many Mountains of huge Stones calcin'd and burnt, which appears all over this Iſland, eſpecially in the South-weſt part of it, were caſt up, and raiſed out of the bowels of the Earth at the time of that general Conflagration; and that the greateſt quantity of this Sulphur lying about the Center of the Iſland, raiſed up the <hi>Pico</hi> to that heighth at which it is now ſeen. And he ſaith, That any one upon the Place, that ſhall carefully note the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manner of thoſe calcined Rocks, how they lie, will eaſily be of that
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:56692:463"/>mind; for they lie (ſays he) three or four Miles almoſt round the bottom of the <hi>Pico,</hi> and in ſuch order one above another almoſt to the <hi>Sugar-Loaf,</hi> as 'tis call'd, as if the whole Ground ſwelling and riſing up together by the aſcenſion of the Brimſtone, the Torrents and Rivers of it, did with a ſudden eruption rowl and rumble them down from the reſt of the Rocks, eſpecially (as is ſaid before) to the South-weſt; for on that ſide from the very top of the <hi>Pico</hi> almoſt to the Sea-coaſt, lie huge heaps of theſe burnt Rocks one under another: and there ſtill remain the very tracks of the Brimſtone-Rivers, as they ran over this quarter of the Iſland, which hath ſo waſted the Ground beyond recovery, that nothing can be made to grow there but Broom: But on the North-ſide of the <hi>Pico,</hi> few or none of theſe Stones appear; and hence he concludes, That the <hi>Vulcanio</hi> diſcharged it ſelf chiefly on the South-weſt-ſide. He adds farther, That at the ſame time, Mynes of ſeveral Metals were blown up, ſome of thoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined Rocks reſembling Iron, Oar, ſome Silver, and others Copper; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on the South-weſt part, call'd <hi>Azuleios,</hi> being very high Mountains, where never any <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man but himſelf (that ever he heard of) was. There are vaſt quantities of a looſe blewiſh Earth, mixed with blew Stones, which have a yellow ruſt upon them, like that of Copper or Vitriol; as alſo many ſmall Springs of Vitriol-water, where he ſuppoſes a Copper Myne. And he was told by a Bell-Founder of <hi>Oratava,</hi> That he got out of two Horſe-loads of this Earth, as much Gold as made two large Rings. And a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> who had been in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> told him, That his opinion was, there were as good Mynes of Gold and Silver there, as the beſt in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> Thereabouts alſo are Nitrous-waters and Stones, cover'd over with a deep Saffron-colour'd ruſt, taſting of Iron. And farther, he mentions one of his Friends, which of two Lumps of Earth, or Oar, brought from the top of this ſide of the Mountain, made two Silver Spoons. All this he confirmed by the laſt Inſtance of the <hi>Palm-Iſland,</hi> eighteen Leagues from <hi>Teneriff,</hi> where, about twelve years ſince, ſo <hi>Vulcanio</hi> was fixed, the violence whereof made an Earthquake in this Iſland, ſo great, that he and others ran out of their Houſes, fearing they would have fall'n upon their Heads. They heard the noiſe of the Torrent of flaming Brimſtone like Thunder, and ſaw the Fire as plain by night for ſix weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a burning Torch, and ſo much Sand and Aſhes, brought from thence by the Wind and Clouds, fell upon his Hat, as would fill the Sand-box of his Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn.</p>
                  <p>In ſome places of this Iſland groweth a crooked Shrub call'd <hi>Legnan,</hi> which they bring for <hi>England</hi> as a ſweet Wood. There are likewiſe Apricock, Peach-Trees, and others, which bear twice a year; alſo Pear-Trees as preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; Almonds, with a tender Shell; Palms, Plantains, Oranges and Lemons, eſpecially the <hi>Paeguada's,</hi> which have ſmall ones within them, from whence they are ſo denominated. Alſo they have Sugar-Canes, and a little Cotton, <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> &amp;c. The Roſes blow at <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> There are good Carnations, and very large; but no Tulips will grow or thrive there. Samphire clothes the Rocks in abundance, and a kind of Clover, the Ground. Another Graſs grows near the Sea, which is of a broader Leaf, ſo luſcious and rank, that it will kill a Horſe that eats of it, but no other Beaſt. Eighty Ears of Wheat have been found to ſpring from one Root, but grows not very high. The Corn of this is tranſparent like the pureſt yellow Amber, and one Buſhel hath brought forth a hundred in a ſeaſonable Year.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Canary</hi>-Birds which they bring to us in <hi>England,</hi> breed in the <hi>Baranco's,</hi>
                     <pb n="740" facs="tcp:56692:464"/>or <hi>Gills,</hi> which the Water hath fretted away in the Mountains, being places very cold. There are alſo Quails, Partridges, larger than ours, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beautiful, great Wood-Pigeons; Turtles at Spring, Crows, and ſometimes the Falcons come flying over from the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Bees are carry'd into the Mountains, where they proſper exceedingly. And there they have wild Goats, which climb to the very top of the <hi>Pico</hi> ſometimes; alſo Hogs, and multitudes of Coneys.</p>
                  <p>Of Fiſh they have the <hi>Cherna,</hi> a very large and excellent Fiſh, better ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted than any we have in <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Mero,</hi> Dolphins, Lobſters, without great Claws, Muſsles, Periwincles, and the <hi>Clacas,</hi> which is abſolutely the very beſt Shell-fiſh in the world; they grow in the Rocks, five or ſix under one great Shell, through the top-holes whereof they peep out with their Nebs; from whence (the Shells being broken open a little more with a Stone) they draw them. There is alſo another ſort of Fiſh like an Eel, which hath ſix or ſeven Tails of a Span long, united to one Head and Body, which is alſo as ſhort. Beſides, there they have Turtles and <hi>Cabrido's,</hi> which are better than our Trouts.</p>
                  <p>The Iſland is full of Springs of freſh Water, taſting like Milk; which in <hi>Lalagima,</hi> where the Water is not ſo clear and lympid, they cleanſe by percola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it through a kind of ſpungy Stone, cut in form of a Baſon.</p>
                  <p>The Vines which afford thoſe excellent Wines, grow all about the Iſland within a Mile of the Sea; ſuch as are planted farther up are not eſteem'd, nor will they thrive in any of the other Iſlands. Concerning the <hi>Guanchio's,</hi> or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Inhabitants, he gave this full account:</p>
                  <p>The third of <hi>September,</hi> about twelve years ſince, he took his Journey from <hi>Guimar,</hi> a Town for the moſt part inhabited by ſuch as derive themſelves from the antient <hi>Guanchio's,</hi> in the Company of ſome of them, to view their Caves, and the Corps buried in them, (a favour they ſeldom or never permit to any, having the Corps of their Anceſtors in great veneration, and likewiſe being extremely againſt any moleſtation of the Dead) but he had done ſeveral Elee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſinary Cures among them, for they are very poor (yet the pooreſt think themſelves too good to Marry with the beſt <hi>Spaniard</hi>) which endeared him to them exceedingly, otherwiſe it is death for any Stranger to viſit theſe Caves and Bodies. The Corps are ſew'd up in Goat-skins with Thongs of the ſame, with very great curioſity, particularly in the incomparable exactneſs and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Seams; and the Skins are made very cloſe and fit to the Corps; which for the moſt part are entire, the Eyes clos'd, Hair on their Heads, Ears, Noſe, Teeth, Lips and Beard, all perfect, onely diſcolour'd, and a little ſhri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd; likewiſe the <hi>Pudenda</hi> of both Sexes. He ſaw about three or four hundred in ſeveral Caves, ſome of them ſtanding, others lying upon Beds of Wood, ſo hardned by an Art they had (which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Curay,</hi> to cure a piece of Wood,) that no Iron can pierce or hurt it. Theſe Bodies are very light, as if made of Straw; and in ſome broken Bodies be obſerv'd the Nerves and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and alſo the String of the Veins and Arteries very diſtinctly. By the relation of the moſt antient of this Iſland, they had a particular Tribe that had this Art onely among themſelves, and kept it as a thing ſacred, and not to be communicated to the Vulgar. Theſe mixt not themſelves with the reſt of the Inhabitants, nor Marry'd out of their own Tribe, and were alſo their Prieſts and Miniſters of Religion. But when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> conquer'd the Place, moſt of them were deſtroy'd, and the Art periſht with them; onely they held ſome Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:56692:464"/>yet of a few Ingredients that were us'd in this buſineſs; they took But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (ſome ſay they mixed Bears-greaſe with it) which they kept for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the Skins; wherein they boyl'd certain Herbs, firſt a kind of wild La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, which grows there in great quantities upon the Rocks; ſecondly, an Herb call'd <hi>Lara,</hi> of a very gummy and glutinous conſiſtence, which now grows there under the tops of the Mountains; thirdly, a kind of <hi>Cyclamen,</hi> or Sow-bread; fourthly, wild Sage, which grows plentifully upon this Iſland. Theſe with others, bruiſed, and boyl'd up with Butter, rendred it a perfect Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. This prepar'd, they firſt unbowel the Corps (and in the poorer ſort, to ſave Charges, took out the Brain behind:) after the Body was thus order'd, they had in readineſs a <hi>Lixivium</hi> made of the Bark of Pine-Trees, wherewith they waſht the Body, drying it in the Sun in Summer, and in the Winter in a Stove, this repeating very often: Afterward they began their Unction both without and within, drying it as before; this they continu'd till the Balſom had penetrated into the whole Habit, and the Muſcle, in all parts appear'd through the contracted Skin, and the Body became exceeding light: then they ſew'd them up in the Goat-skins, as was mention'd before.</p>
                  <p>The Antients ſay, that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and great Perſonages, with their whole Families, yet unknown to any but themſelves, and which they will never diſcover.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly he ſays, That Bodies are found in the Caves of the <hi>Grand Canaries,</hi> in Sacks, quite conſumed, and not as theſe in <hi>Teneriff.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Antiently, when they had no knowledge of Iron, they made their Lances of Wood, hardned as before mention'd.</p>
                  <p>They have Earthen Pots, ſo hard that they cannot be broken: Of theſe ſome are found in the Caves, and old <hi>Bavances,</hi> and us'd by the poorer People that find them, to boyl Meat in.</p>
                  <p>Their Food is Barley Parched, and then Ground with little Stone-Mills, and mingled with Milk and Honey, which they always carry with them in Goat-skins at their Backs.</p>
                  <p>To this day they drink no Wine, nor care for Fleſh: they are very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, lean, tall, active, and full of courage; for they will leap from Rock to Rock, from a very prodigious heighth till they come to the bottom, ſometimes making ten Fathom deep at one Leap, in this manner: Firſt they <hi>Tertiate</hi> their Lances, which are about the bigneſs of a Half-Pike, and aim with the Point at any piece of a Rock upon which they intend to light, ſometimes not half a Foot broad; in leaping off they clap their Feet cloſe to the Lance, and ſo carry their Bodies in the Air: the Point of the Lance comes firſt to the place, which breaks the force of their fall; then they ſlide gently down by the Staff, and pitch with their Feet on the very place they firſt deſign'd, and ſo from Rock to Rock, till they come to the bottom: But their Novices ſometimes break their Necks in the learning.</p>

In the middle ſtand five ſquare Wooden Buildings, whoſe in-ſides are adorn'd in very good Order with all ſorts of Defenſive Arms, as Cuiraſſes, Coats of Mail, Caskets, Head-pieces, Shields, Back-ſwords, Halberds, Pikes, Half-Lances, Muskets, Dags, Ponyards, Piſtols, Snap-hances, and ſuch like. Above hang many Bowes, and other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, us'd of old by the Knights of <hi>Rhodes.</hi> In brief, there are ſufficient of all ſorts to equip ſix and thirty thouſand Men. There are three or four compleat Suits of Armor, <hi>Cap-a-pe;</hi> the middlemoſt being that which the Grand Maſter <hi>De la Valette,</hi> in the Siege in the year Sixteen hundred ſixty five, us'd. There is alſo a Piece of Cannon upon the Carriage, made of Leather; but with ſo great Art and Curioſity, that it ſeems verily an Iron Piece. All theſe Arms are kept very clean and bright, by Officers to that onely purpoſe appointed. Every Knight, notwithſtanding all this Proviſion, hath his Arms by himſelf, in his own Houſe; as have alſo the Citizens, and Countrey People. The <hi>Banjert</hi> is a large Houſe or Priſon, wherein many Slaves of all Nations are bought and ſold.</p>
                  <p>They have a Cuſtom-houſe, Treaſury, Chancery, and Magazine for Wine and Corn; a Caſtle for the Courts of Juſtice, Princely Stables for Horſes, and a ſeparate Field, with all Conveniences, for the Founding of Great Ordnance.</p>
                  <p>The Caſtle of <hi>St. Elmo,</hi> built upon a Rock, on the Out-point of <hi>Valette</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea, is as it were encompaſs'd with ſeveral fair and large Havens; three on the right ſide, and five on the left; all guarded by the Caſtle of <hi>St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi> built on the Point of <hi>Burgo,</hi> or <hi>Citta Vittorioſo.</hi> Between this Caſtle and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi> are Corn-pits hewn in the Rocks.</p>
                  <p>In the great Haven over againſt <hi>Valette,</hi> are two long ſlips of Land,
<note place="margin">Fort <hi>St. Angelo.</hi>
                     </note> with their Points; in one whereof, ſeated upon a Rock, lieth the Caſtle <hi>St. Angelo;</hi> and beſides it, nothing remarkable, but an old ſmall Church, built firſt by the Clergy of this Order, wherein you may ſee the Tomb of the Grand-Maſter <hi>Philip de Villiers d' Iſle Dam,</hi> who there with the Order, after the loſs of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> in the year Fifteen hundred and thirty, the ſix and twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> took his firſt Reſidence, after eight Years Adventures. It was formerly ſtrengthen'd with many Bulwarks and Walls; provided with Wells of Water, a Magazine of Arms, together with a Palace for the Knights: but ſince the Siege of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in the Year Sixteen hundred fifty five, greatly decay'd. Here ſtands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an Hoſpital for ſick and poor Diſeaſed Mariners, who are ſerv'd by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Knights, with Silver Veſſels, in good order. Laſtly, A Yard or Dock for the Building of Galleys, with <hi>Barrakes</hi> or Store-houſes adjoyning; neighbor'd by the ſtately Manſion of the General of the Galleys.</p>
                  <p>Beyond this, upon the ſame Rock, ſtands <hi>Citta Vittorioſo,</hi> ſo call'd becauſe of the foremention'd Siege which it endur'd from the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was built by the Grand Maſter <hi>Philip de Villiers d' Iſle Dam,</hi> when the Knights had firſt the Poſſeſſion of this Iſland given them; and at this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently Fortified. It contains in Circuit half a Mile, wherein about twelve hundred Houſes, and theſe following Churches, <hi>viz. St. Andria, Maria della

                  </p>
                  <p>Between <hi>Burgo</hi> and <hi>La Iſula</hi> lies a Haven, wherein all the Capers and Galleys of <hi>Malta</hi> harbor, with their Prizes, as well <hi>Turks</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> The Entrance, at the coming of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, was chain'd up. In <hi>La Iſula</hi> are four Churches; <hi>Maria Porto Salvo, Madama de Victoria, St. Philippo Nere,</hi> and <hi>St. Julian.</hi> At the end of the Haven, beyond the City, on the Eaſt ſide, lieth <hi>Burmola,</hi> as being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, inhabited by Strangers; together with two Havens, one call'd <hi>La Marza,</hi> and the other <hi>La Marza Picciola,</hi> that is, <hi>The Small Haven.</hi>

Under this Church is a Grot, with two or three Entrances; yet few People venture into it, becauſe of the ſeveral ſtrange Meanders, and diſmal narrowneſs of the place; and therefore one of theſe Entrances, being more dangerous than the reſt, was cloſed up by Command.

<pb n="749" facs="tcp:56692:472"/>of Entertainment, beſides private Receſſes, and particular Apartments: This, in regard of its diſtance, is not ſo much frequented, as that of <hi>San Gioſeppo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer, whither the Grand Maſters and the whole Court often retire for Recreation.</p>
                  <p>On the South-Coaſt, and that ſide towards <hi>Tripolis,</hi> this Iſland hath nothing but great Cliffs and Rocks; but on the other ſide, ſeveral Capes, convenient for ſmall Boats.

                  </p>
                  <p>But to the Weſtward appear two great Roads; one call'd <hi>Antfega,</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Malteſian</hi> Orthography, <hi>Hayntoffeka;</hi> and the other, <hi>Porto del Mugaro.</hi> Paſſing thence Weſtwards, you arrive at <hi>Meleca,</hi> a good Landing-place, over againſt which the Iſland <hi>Goze</hi> ſhews it ſelf, ſever'd from <hi>Malta</hi> by a narrow Channel, intituled <hi>Feo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Eaſtern Coaſt brings you to <hi>Porto delle Saline Vecchie, The Haven of the Old Salt-Pit.</hi>

                  <p>Right out from thence, over againſt <hi>Sicily,</hi> you come to <hi>Cala di Sante Paulo, The Cape of St. Paul,</hi> and by that a Bay; ſo call'd, becauſe the Inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That the Ship wherein the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was brought over Captive, by Storm was caſt away, and Shipwrack'd againſt this Place; though ſome (with what Reaſon we will not determine) imagine that Shipwrack to have been ſuffer'd not here, but upon the Iſland <hi>Melite</hi> by <hi>Ragouſa.</hi>

                  <p>This Bay ſends an Arm well near two <hi>Italian</hi> Miles up into the Countrey; but neither broad, nor deep. The adjacent Shore being full of Rocks, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appearing above the Surface of the Water, confirms the Arguments of <hi>St. Paul's</hi> Shipwrack here. In the place where the Viper leap'd out of the Fire to the hand of the Apoſtle, the firſt converted <hi>Chriſtians</hi> erected a ſmall Chappel, being ſince decay'd by Wind and Weather; but of late renew'd again: So that now there ſtands a handſom little Church, rebuilt in the Year Sixteen hundred and ſixteen, by the Grand Maſter <hi>Alophi Tignacourt.</hi> Above the Altar in the Church are to be ſeen divers Images decyphering the Miracle done by the Apoſtle, in flinging off the Viper from his Hand, himſelf kneeling; with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Figures of Men and Women, bigger than the Life, round about, in Old <hi>Malteſia</hi> Garments, cut out with excellent Poſtures, to admiration.

                     </note> the Grand Maſter hath his faireſt Garden of Pleaſure, call'd <hi>Boſchetto,</hi> ſeated on the top of a high Rock, not without great Charge, all the Earth being carried up to it; and planted with Orange, Lemon, Citron, Pomegranate, Olive, and other Trees; together with ſeveral rare and unuſual Plants: Near which he hath a Park of Deer, a Warren of Hares, Coneys, and a Wood of Olive-Trees, wherein breed Stags and Hinds; beſides ſeveral excellent natural Springs, and rare artificial Water-works; and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace beautified with ſpacious Halls and Chambers, with a flat Roof, upon which ſome Pieces of Ordnance are planted: From this Place you will eaſily believe the Proſpect cannot be unpleaſant. Between this Court <hi>Boſchetto,</hi> and <hi>Old Malta,</hi> lies <hi>Gardino del Veſcone, The Garden of the Biſhop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not far from <hi>Citta Vecchia</hi> may be ſeen a Grot of white, but ſoft Stone, wherein the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> after his Shipwrack, Preach'd: And three <hi>Italian</hi> Miles further,
<note place="margin">The Court <hi>Balda.</hi>
                     </note> the Court <hi>Balda,</hi> or <hi>Vaſſalo,</hi> extraordinarily frequented; for it hath an Orchard ſo fruitful, that the like is not in the whole Iſland; planted with many ſorts of very large Grapes, white and brown Figs, and delicious Peaches, with a moſt delightful Fountain. A Mile without <hi>Valette</hi> lieth a Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, call'd <hi>St. Mattheo della Makkluba,</hi> where, upon <hi>St. Matthias</hi> day, a great Fair is holden.</p>
                  <p>Fifty or ſixty Paces from that Cloyſter, formerly ſtood the Town <hi>Makkluba,</hi> but now quite ſwallow'd up in Earth, nothing remaining but a Hole forty or fifty Fathom deep, and in the opening at the top, five hundred Paces in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</p>
                  <p>Three Miles from thence, right over againſt the Iſland <hi>Forfala,</hi> you arrive at <hi>Gibel Ciantor,</hi> containing a Garden, and ſmall Church, under which is a Cave, with a very fair Spring, furniſh'd with a Stone Table, and Seat, for thoſe that come thither to recreate and take their pleaſure. From this place runneth a ſteep winding Way, from below, to the top of the Mountain; and from thence another, as rugged and rocky, to <hi>Boſchetto</hi> before-mention'd.</p>
                  <p>The Ground,
<note place="margin">The ſtrange power of the Stony Rocks.</note> or rather the Rocks (which are moſt of them black, yellow, and ſoft, and therefore eaſie to be wrought) they ſay, that ſince the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did that Miracle there, have been bleſſed, with producing certain great and ſmall Serpents Tongues, of ſeveral colours and forms; as alſo of round Orange colour'd, and black Serpents eyes and Teeth, and certain Scaly Stones, in the form of a Serpents Skin; beſides ſeveral other rarities, ſo ſhap'd, that they ſeem to repreſent the Life. Theſe Eyes and Serpents Tongues, they ſay, have a wonderful vertue in them, againſt all ſorts of Poyſon, and Bitings of Venomous Beaſts; not onely to preſerve from the hurt, but afford a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Remedy to ſuch as have taken Poyſon, or been bitten by any Venomous Creature; yea ſome have no leſs commended them than the <hi>Bezoar</hi>-Stone in <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <p>The manner of uſing theſe Stones, is thus; The Eyes are commonly worn upon the Ring-finger, as a pretious Stone, ſo that it may touch the bare Skin, and the Tongues upon the Neck and Arms, Water, or Wine, or ſome other moyſture mingled therewith and taken, or therein for a while laid to ſteep, or elſe Wine or Water, drank out of Cups or Cans made thereof: Alſo the Stone of <hi>St. Paul's</hi> Cave, being very white and ſoft, hath the like vertue aſcribed to it againſt all Biting and Stinging of Venomous Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>The whole Iſland ſtands upon a Rock, ſo that no place can be found, where the Earth lieth more than four Foot deep; the beſt quarter is about <hi>Boſchetto,</hi> and if the reſt of the Iſland were as this, the Knights would not need to fetch their Proviſions from abroad; yet notwithſtanding the natural unfruitfulneſs, by labour and diligence, the Soyl brings forth many things, particularly Corn, but in no great abundance, for all will not ſuffice to feed the Inhabitants above three moneths; the reſt they fetch from <hi>Sicily,</hi> and other places.</p>
                  <p>Cummin, in the <hi>Arabick</hi> call'd <hi>Camum</hi> or <hi>Cemum,</hi> and by the <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>Malayan</hi> Tongue, <hi>Jenta Nyeran,</hi> they Sowe in great quantity, becauſe it thrives, as delighting in a ſtony Soil. They have of two ſorts, one white, ſlender and ſharp, of a rank ſmell, and tart in taſte, call'd <hi>Cimonageron,</hi> that is, wild Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and like the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Cummin of the Apothecaries: The other much ſmaller, like Anniſe-ſeed, whitiſh, having a deadiſh taſte, and ſweetiſh. The firſt they uſe in ſtead of Spice, the other the Inhabitants mix with Bread, to give it a pleaſant reliſh; from hence they are brought all over <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo Cotton, as good, if not much better than grows any where elſe; onely we muſt obſerve, that the Cotton Planted here is but an Herb or Shrub, with a ſtalk of a Foot and half long, ſown, and dying every year; but the other which grows in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and all over <hi>Aſsia,</hi> ſhoots up to the height of a Tree, with a Stem, and hard wooddy Boughs.

But when at laſt theſe Cloyſters began to grow too ſmall for ſuch great numbers as thither reſorted, the Siſterhood concluded to build a great Hoſpital or Alms-houſe, for entertainment both of Sick and Well; and put at the ſame time an Overſeer therein, choſen by the Abbot.

The Grand Maſter, the Biſhop of <hi>Malta,</hi> the Prior of the Church of <hi>St. John,</hi> the Conventual and Capital Bailiffs, wear the great Croſs upon their Breaſts; but all the other, the little One. Every Brother by obligation muſt every day repeat an hundred and fifty <hi>Pater Noſters</hi> for ſuch as have been ſlain in their Wars: But the Prieſts, Deacons, Sub-Deacons, and Clerks, perform other Offices.

The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Forces ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd the eighteenth of <hi>June,</hi> about four or five Miles from <hi>Malta;</hi> upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice whereof from the Caſtle, and the Old City <hi>St. Angelo,</hi> a great fear poſſeſs'd the poor People in the Countrey, who immediately betook themſelves, with what they had, to the Fortifi'd Places; but the Knights, Soldiers, and other Warlike People, betook themſelves to Arms. The Grand Maſter <hi>De Valette</hi> caus'd immediately all the Water on the Iſland to be poyſon'd with Arſnick, or Ratsbane, and other appropriate Drugs; and muſter'd all his Forces, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of about eight thouſand five hundred Fighting Men of all Nations; with one Troop of <hi>Banditi,</hi> or Exiles, of <hi>Cicilia,</hi> who behav'd themſelves very vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly. In the Night the <hi>Turks</hi> went out with a Rere-guard of five and thirty Ships, and ſet three thouſand Men on Shore by the <hi>Cape of St. Thomas,</hi> who were follow'd continually by many others in Barques; for their Landing in the day-time was prevented by the Marſhal <hi>Copier,</hi> who was drawn thither with a thouſand Horſe; but the Grand Maſter commanded him at laſt, That as ſoon as the Enemy was Landed, he ſhould Retreat to the Fort; and ſent the General of <hi>Gio,</hi> with a Troop of Knights and Foot-Soldiers, to impede their March. The Marſhal, before he had receiv'd theſe Orders, had ſent a Party of Horſe, under the Conduct of one <hi>Egaras,</hi> to <hi>Mugaro,</hi> to get Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and to entrap one <hi>Turk</hi> or other, in hopes to learn ſome News: But this prevented not their coming on, and making further Attempts; whereby, after many flerce Aſſaults made upon the Beſiged, with the loſs of many of their Men, the Beſieged at laſt were reduc'd to Extremity; when in a lucky Hour, they receiv'd not only Comfort, but freſh Courage, by the coming of <hi>Don Alvaro Garcia,</hi> who after a long ſtay, provided with a good number of Ships and Soldiers, came in the ſight of <hi>Malta</hi> about Noon, on the ſixteenth of <hi>September,</hi> in the year Fifteen hundred fifty ſix; but kept till the next Break of day about the Iſland <hi>Comin;</hi> and then he approach'd with his Fleet under <hi>Malta,</hi> by a Place call'd <hi>Melekka,</hi> and Landed all his Aids in leſs than an Hours
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:56692:481"/>time; but went back himſelf with his Galleys to <hi>Sicily,</hi> with promiſe to return again in ſix days. Hereupon both the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> gave command to Fire all the Guns againſt the Fort, and the Iſland <hi>Sengle,</hi> and immediately to bring them on Board the Ships; and ſo preſently forſaking their Trenches, and ſetting their Huts on fire, ſail'd away with their Fleet. The <hi>Baſſa's</hi> arriving at <hi>Galipolis,</hi> made their Adventures known to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> by Letters, and how that ſince their departure from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> they had loſt thirty thouſand Seamen and Soldiers together. The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> receiv'd this Letter with ſo much diſcontent, that he threw it on the ground, and ſaid with a loud voice, <hi>That his Sword had no luck in another Mans Hand:</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> were receiv'd with ſigns of great Honor at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with the Beatings of Drums, and Sounding of other Inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>The Pope alſo held a Solemn Proceſſion at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein himſelf in Perſon aſſiſted, to thank God for the Preſervation and Deliverance of <hi>Malta;</hi> and wiſh'd the Grand Maſter, in his Letter to him of the tenth of <hi>October,</hi> much Happineſs with his Glorious Victory. The Grand Maſter <hi>Valette</hi> caus'd by a Collection to be gather'd at <hi>Lyons, Marſeiles, Lovorn, Naples,</hi> and on other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Gunpowder, Saltpetre, Metal for caſting Guns, all ſorts of Arms, Maſts for Shipping, all ſorts of Neceſſaries of Wood and Iron, and other needful Things, for the ſtrengthening of the Iſland. Moreover it was concluded (for the better conveniency of the Iſland) to build a City on the Mountain <hi>Sceber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras.</hi> Towards the building of this City, ſince call'd <hi>Valette,</hi> thirty thouſand <hi>Eſcues,</hi> or Gold Crowns, were taken up at Intereſt by the Order at <hi>Palermo:</hi> The Pope himſelf gave to that end five thouſand out of his own Purſe, and ſent thither a great quantity of Gunpowder and Saltpetre, with a Maſter-Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er call'd <hi>Francois Laparel,</hi> and offer'd the Grand Maſter a Cardinals Cap; but he modeſtly refus'd the ſame. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> gave towards this Building a Preſent of thirty thouſand <hi>Eſcues;</hi> the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> thirty thouſand <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoes;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, a hundred and forty thouſand <hi>Guilders.</hi> Then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, by the command of the Grand Maſter, all ſorts of People were ſet to work upon the Fortifications, and to ſcowr and cleanſe the Ditches and Moats, to which the Knights themſelves put their helping hand: And from the Caſtle of <hi>St. Elmo,</hi> where onely before a Ditch had been, there was now a Moat cut in the Rock, down to the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Maſter being brought to the corner of the Bulwark <hi>St. John,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many Benedictions, and other Ceremonies, laid the firſt Stone of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Whereupon the Maſter-Builder <hi>Laparel</hi> kiſs'd his hands, and had beſtow'd on him a gold Chain with a Medal, which the Grand Maſter put about his neck. Under this Stone ſeveral Gold, Silver, and Copper Medals were laid, for an everlaſting Mark and Remembrance of the Building, whereof the beſt had this <hi>Latin</hi> Inſcription, <hi>Immotam Colli dedit,</hi> that is, <hi>He hath built the City immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon a Rock.</hi> On this firſt Stone Letters were cut, which manifeſted the utmoſt danger which they endur'd in this Siege, with the Happy Succeſs, and their Deliverance; and likewiſe the Occaſion and Reaſon of this Building, with a Prayer to God, and the Name of the Grand Maſter <hi>Valette</hi> the Founder. The ſame Grand Maſter preſented the City likewiſe with a Coat of Arms, being upon a Round Scutcheon, a Field <hi>Or,</hi> charg'd with a Lion <hi>Gules:</hi> After which Ceremony, all the Guns round about were Fir'd, and Gold and Silver Money, Coyn'd with the Picture of the Grand Maſter, thrown amongſt the People, who all cry'd, <hi>Vive le Grand Valette,</hi> that is, <hi>Long live the Grand Valette.</hi> The
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:56692:481"/>Charges to the Workmen amounted daily to the Sum of fifteen hundred or two thouſand Crowns; but to eaſe the Payment, and to make good the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the Grand Maſter caus'd Copper Money to be made: One Piece to the value of two <hi>Tarins;</hi> on the one ſide, with the Arms of the Order and the Grand Maſter; and on the other ſide, with the Mark or Enſign of his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with theſe Words about the Border, <hi>Non Aes, ſed Fides;</hi> that is, <hi>Not Coyn, but Fidelity.</hi>
